And sure enough, at five they managed to make it into the music industry. Just kids songs at first, yet they became hits around the country. The camera loved them, with the amount of different sorts of appearances they'd make. 

Of course, the joy of stardom was mostly faked. Draco would force themselves into the perfect child role to please their parents, or a beating would be imminent. And that wouldn't please the crowd.  

They skipped another grade, landing themselves in the same year as their sister. They managed to get into Zios High at fourteen.  

And at Zios High, they chose to hide their life of stardom except to those who recognized them. The place was across the country anyway.  

Zios High was the only place they could act out. They could let their temper out without them losing their status. 

Then the day of the fights came. They weren't in that club, sure, but they were mad. They were mad cause their sister, and so many others, had died or were going to die. 

And it was all at the hands of Liza.

They couldn't fight Liza, though! That would cause scandal all over the world! Outrage!

They could fight the kid who murdered zer, though. They could beat them into a pulp and then at last, gain their revenge. 

Because their life was crazy, and they had to roll with the punches. Sometimes, they had to make the punches, too.

''FAT NOTE THE ART ISNT MINE ITS JUST THE PROJECT SEKAI COVER FOR THE SONG. COLORFUL PALETTE DONT KILL ME''

''Picture this as your life: You're a high-school student, running through an odd school with someone chasing you throughout the halls. As you go up the stairs, you see the mysterious person.. only saying one word to you As they push you off the stairs with a strange object.. But.. suddenly you end up back in your bed where you were before that strange dream without remembering the very dream you had.''  

''As a new girl in school appears, you cant find records on her: Nothing of her seems to exist, and is only referred as "she." But, when entering a dream-like world after you slept. it would be the same day.''   

''everyday.''  [[File:Kagerou Daze (pjsekai cover not my image).webp|center|thumb|389x389px]]
[[File:Kagerou Daze music.ogg|center|thumb|original version: listen to this as you read along[[File:Kagerou Daze (Project sekai version).ogg|center|thumb|project sekai version if the original isnt for you ^_^]]

== Author's note ==
Hi, so this is a small story I would be working on incase I am bored. I had gotten this story idea from project sekai when I listened to the song "Kagerou Daze" which translates into "Heat-haze daze." Its about a guy stuck in a time-loop trying to save someone from getting hit by a truck or something among the lines of that. This version will be different however since it's my own take on the story. 

To see all character sheets, please go to [https://wildworks-writing.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:L%C3%B8vey_petals./kagerou_daze_characters Kagerou Daze Characters.] It will contain brief summaries for each character that will be added in the future. It is best to check these out for an infographic on each character. 

But the catch here is he did not die, but he would be repeating the loop over and over again, meet some people who also have this loop, but does not know who had put them in a never-ending time loop, to which they have to break it before it is too late.

Disclamer: this is simply a version of the story I had thought of because i listened to the song and thought, "hey, why not write a story on it?" Since i got fascinated with the concept of time loops. also, the story takes place on the first of September instead. since I live in North America, some schools here actually start in September instead of august: i know some schools can start in august but i prefer to make it September, so i apologize if it kills the point of the song anyways. Since it starts on the first of September, the weather can still be extremely hot during that time because summer has not officially ended yet. 

some small warnings: '''this will contain a lot of blood, some swear words that are obviously censored, and alot of stuff that is not child friendly so if youre sensitive to this content, please click out immediately and read another page.''' this will also be very dialogue heavy so please beware that theres not gonna be alot of description scenes + alot of first perspective thoughts. Some metaphors, similes and dialogue will sound extremely wonky its because im still trying to practice and all. So yeah, enjoy this piece of garbage fire. yes this idea was better in my head, not for writing at all.

one more time: this is just a story i basically made in my head when I listened to the song, specifically the project sekai version. no, its not based off of the kagerou project except the time loop part where someone dies and they keep having to live the same exact moments everyday but they still try to find a way to break the loop.  

also i added two versions of the song. so if you wanna listen to either one when reading some of this, please do. its a good song and all but if its too short ill upload a full version.  

its essentially about trying to break the loop that someone had put them in, and not trying to save someone from dying. Of course the story of Kagerou Daze is about someone trapped in a time loop trying to save someone from meeting the same fate. i am not really familiar with the Kagerou Project story but please let me know about more of it and if the other songs connect to this.

''Ergh.. Hrr..'' 

''Agh.. What just happened..''

''I feel so drowsy.. And tired..'' 

''My head hurts.. maybe it was the coffee I-''

''W-Wait a second..''

''.. W-Where.. am I?''

''How did I even get here?''

''This.. looks like a school hallway..''

''But.. why am I in school so late in the night?''

''They're usually closed at this time of day.''

''Just a couple of hours ago, I was asleep in my bed after a long shift at work..''

''Is this just a dream?'' 

''Or some stupid prank someone had pulled on me by taking me to the school?''

''Well- the second one is unlikely.. I do not have much friends of my own..''

''Though.. this place does look rather fascinating to the eye..''

'''''*''Peeking in pocket*''' ''Well-'' ''Atleast I still have my notebook..''

''I might as-well just explore for my own benefit, since theres nothing to do inside of here..''

''Hmm...'' 

'''''NOTEBOOK''':'' 

''Observations:''

''- Many windows, showing the stars and the moon''.

- ''A large window for a better view of the outside scenery.''

- ''Old lockers without any lock.'' 

''- A strange scent that arouses the entire school.'' 

- ''Odd silence that echoes throughout the building.''

- ''Hot temperature in the building despite being the first of September.''

- ''No air conditioning, No doors that lead to an exit.''

- ''Many stairwells, a lot of stairs.''

- ''Classrooms with no one inside and untouched equipment, all locked doors.''

- ''No security guards that patrol the area.'' 

''- Weird notes that fill the front of the lockers.''

-''Many overhead line''s ''neatly lined up outside, a set of train tracks underneath, triangular signs mixed with red and white following.'' 

''There was no train passing by.'' 

-''The sound of cicadas that echo throughout the building, despite none being outside, or even in the building.'' 

''-Even though it is night, the sky is a blinding blue color, but the aspects apart of the night are still apparent.'' 

----''What a strange school.''

''It's somewhat like a cage..'' 

''I can't seem to get out at all.''

''And its oddly hot too despite being the night time.. I feel like i'm melting at most..'' 

''So many notes on the lockers..'' 

''I cant even see the body of the locker anymore.'' 

''It's just notes that cover everything..''

" ''̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶a̶c̶t̶i̶o̶n̶s̶'̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶e̶q̶u̶e̶n̶c̶e̶s̶.̶ ̶''

''They look like they're repeating the same thing over and over again..''

''Some of the words were completely written over...''

''or not even written at all.''

''What does it even say..''

''Kage..rou.. da..ze?''"

''What can that possibly mean?'' 

''How strange and odd.'' 

''These halls..''

''I feel like something is off..'' 

''Maybe i'm just not the only person inside..'' 

''There has to be someone else, right?''

''But.. I cannot tell if this is a dream.. or reality.''

''Everything looks so real..'' 

''but it feels like a dream at the same time.''

''At least the view is quite nice.. oddly nice to be exact.''

''It is still blinding to my eyes, though.''

''But..'' 

''this all feels unrealistic to me..''

''What if i'm trapped here for the rest of my life?'' 

''Perhaps I am just.. overreacting.''

''It's just a school with it's oddities, after-all.''

''I should take a rest, I must be stressed.'' 

''This environment makes me very sleepy, despite the blinding blue sky.'' 

''This spot near the windows is good.'' 

''It has enough space for me to roll in.''

''What strange words did I just hear..?''

''I cannot tell if this is a dream or if this is reality.'' 

''It could be a nightmare, and this is just a dream that I need to get out of..'' 

''Or maybe the voice in my head trying to say something to me.'' 

''It's perhaps non-sense that my brain likes to put in every now and then.'' 

''But.. what is.. d̶o̶o̶m̶s̶d̶a̶y̶?''

''Well.. that was an oddly comfortable rest, despite those strange words echoing in my head.''

''Even though I am trapped in a school, and sleeping on the floor.''

''Perhaps I can after find an exit.'' 

''But, it feels like I cannot escape..'' 

''The classroom doors are locked.''

''When I try opening the windows..'' 

''they're glued shut..'' 

''Even when unlatching the small latches, they don't budge.''

''It's almost like i'm trapped here.''

''In a dark, powerless cage.''

'''*pitter patter, pitter patter..*'''

''Wait a moment..''

''What.. was that...?''

''It.. sounded like.. footsteps..?''

''Who else is here?'' 

''They're.. coming closer and closer from what I can hear..''

''I can see a shadow of someone..''

''A silhouette..''

''Huh?''

''.. Who is that?''

''I cant tell who they are..''

''Nor can I identify them clearly.''

'''''NOTEBOOK:'''''

'''''Appearance description of mysterious individual:'''''

''- Most likely has short dark brown hair.''  

''- Wears a light gray hood with a white shirt underneath.'' 

''Around neck is a choker with a ring-type thing on the side.''

- ''Carrying some strange object in a capsule-like bag that slings around their left shoulder.'' 

''Gender unidentifiable.''

''I cannot tell who they are..''
 
''I don't seem to recognize them from anywhere..''
 
''They are not my friend, nor do they look like any of my co-workers..''

''But why are they staring at me?''

''I can dimly see their expression.. one of an evil smile with a malicious intent..'' 

''And.. what is she holding-'' 

''Oh.. Oh god..'' 

''Oh god!'' 

! T''hey're running towards me, and they're running fast- even holding the capsule in a similar manner of holding a hammer.''

''This is not good..''

''Oh no..'' 

''I need to run! Now!''

''I need to look for an exit if there is one.. there's only classrooms..''

''And the doors are locked..'' 

''The windows don't open either..! Its like they're glued shut-''

''Agh- Come on you stupid doors, open!'' 

''Cmon.. Cmon..'' 

''Oh no-''

''Aaah!''

''They're still chasing me, no matter how far I run, Almost behind me!'' 

''But the further I run in the school, the more darker it becomes..''

''I cant see the blinding blue sky anymore.'' 

''Only darkness with no light to illuminate the room.. Only a visible purple hue..''

''I can hear the footsteps of someone chasing me while I desperately run away and look for a door.''

''There's no exit..'' 

''Not even in the front of the school..''

''My energy is running out.''

''I want to pass out..'' 

''But I dont want to die..!''

''Ah.. Hah.. come on.. there has to be an exit somewhere-''

''Just somewhere in this d*mn school''

''Come on.. Come on!'' 

''She keeps chasing me..'' 

''Even when I call for help, it's like my voice can't be heard anywhere..''

''I cant run anymore.. I feel like my life is almost gone..''

''I want to give up..'' 

''I want to regain my energy..''

''But.. I can't die..! Not just yet..''

''This.. wont be the way I die..''

''But.. where haven't I checked for an exit?-''

''There.. has to be somewhere-''

''....''

''I got it!'' 

''The stairs!'' 

''Yes! the stairs!'' 

''I haven't checked up there yet! There has to be an exit on the second floor!''

''I need to go to see if theres a door..'' 

''I have to get out of here..''

''And fast..''

----''S**t!'' 

''They found me again!''

''they're still on my a**, even after a couple of hours..'' 

''How is she not tired yet!?''

''Holy crap..'' 

''They're behind me, nearly!''

''OH S***!''

''AAAAAH!'' 

'''*SWIIING!*'''

'''*Duck!*'''

''they're trying to swing her capsule bag to hit me..''

''But thank you god I ducked their attack.. those stealth lessons did come in handy..'' 

''Don't worry, me.. I'm almost near the stairwell, and I'll go to the absolute top if that matters!''

''So many stairs... The air in my lungs is limited..'' 

''I feel the taste of blood in my mouth coming from my throat..'' 

''But i'm.. almost to the top! I think I lost them.. I don't hear the footsteps anymore..''

''Finally..'' 

''Ha..Hah.. I could rest for a little..''

''I'll need to see if there's some sort of an exit on the second floor..''

''I think I see something.. Its' rectangular.. has a hollow metal handle..''

''A dark green or black tint to it..''

''Made of an iron material.''

''I see it more clearly now..'' 

''I see a door!'' 

''I can escape through there!''

'''*pitter patter..*'''

''The footsteps.. I can hear them again..!''

''Its them.. they look.. I cannot tell if it's anger..'' 

''Their facial expression.. Is somewhat cold..''

''But.. a malicious smile still fills the air.'' 

'''*Tread, tread, tread..*'''

''There it is!'' 

''The door!''

''I'll be able to reach it in no time, then I can finally get out of here-''

''Wait.. the.. they're..'' 

''up there..'' 

''Alr..eady?''

''No...''

''No way..'' 

''They were..''

''Just behind me.. How?''

''I can hear a sinister laugh..'' 

''A very grim one coming from their breath..'' 

''I'm out of oxygen.. I cant.. seem to walk much more..''  

''The taste of blood in my throat is becoming more apparent..''  

''I need.. to escape..'' 

''You're almost... there- Just..''

''Rush.. towards.. the.. door..''

''Use the strength.. you have left..''

''To.. get past.. her..-''   

''"Haha..'' 

''Fairwell."'' 

''No..'' 

''No No, No!'' 

'''''*SWIIING!*'''''

''Agh..'' 

''Aaah..''

''AAAAAAAAAAAAH!''

''A..a..ah..! The capsule.. hit my stomach..'' 

''I lost my balance..'' 

''Im.. falling down the stairs..'' 

''Slowly.''  

''Please.. I cannot die..'' 

''Not yet.. not now..''

''I have a whole life ahead of me!''

''This is..'' 

''the only time in my life where I can be free..''

''I dont want to die..! Not now!''

And.. more importantly, w-what.. happened to me..? 

I appear to be fine, but..  

I cant remember what had just occurred..   

Was it another dream?  

I can't remember or recall anything that took place..  

It was all so blurry and- strange...   

It was a fast dream too..  

I cant seem to comprehend what happened in my mind..  

Oh well.  

Perhaps it was just-  

One of those night terrors I keep having more and more frequently.. 

It was probably nothing..      

But.. i'm.. shaking..     

I cant.. stop..     

Perhaps i'm tired..     

I should get more rest..     

I'll just go back to sleep. its four in the morning, so I still have two hours of rest..     

and I'll make sure to wake up on time for once.

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;RING!*'''  

AAAAH!   

'''*Bumping head on the headboard of the bed.*'''  

Yeowch..!    

That hurts like h**l..    

Ow.. Oww.. Owww!   

'''*Rubbing the back of his head*'''   

Argh.. What even was that?!-  

'''*Glaring to the left, where the noise came from.*'''   

Oh- It's just my alarm clock.  

Wow..   

That rung rather quickly..   

Almost gave me a heart attack..!  

'''*Time shown: 6:00 AM.*''' Wait, It's already six?  

was just four in the morning a minute ago.. 

How did the time go by that fast?  

Oh well.  

I guess that's how the world works, apparently.  

When going back to sleep thinking you have enough time, you wake up again and boom! It's already six.  

But any-who, I better get up and go to school..  

I can't fall asleep again and wake up at seven in the morning again, otherwise I would be late.  

The alarm on my table was going off and on like a bomb, my hand reaching towards the counter next to me and slouchily turning it off. It was September First, meaning it was the first day of school after a two month summer break, The rays of warm sunshine  coming from my window hitting my face. Summer still had not ended much to my dismay, but the good thing is I would not be freezing to death when walking to school!

As I got up from my bed, I stared at the clock for a few minutes with a blank expression on my face, but it lit up soon after, rubbing my eyes tiredly.  

Good job, Wren! You woke up early this time without going back to sleep like you usually do. Yay me! Now, I need to get ready for school.. Haha, I cant be late again, Otherwise I'd get more tardies than I have ever gotten. It did, after-all, make my schedule somewhat bad and dragged my grade down by a huge amount.. God, attendance grades suck...   

I went over to the bathroom and washed my face with hot water, a towel slinging over my neck so I didn't get my shirt wet, then drying my face off. Looking at myself in the mirror after washing myself you can only see me: Wren Saetang, even though I just said my name seconds ago while I mumbled pointless platitudes to myself.  

Yep, that's me right there!      

Ever since I had that conflict with my family, I fled my own home, moving to a farther district and taking everything with me: Important documents, records of my existence, the little ounces of money I had left, everything. I had the documents professionally forged so I could get a small full-time job as a café attendant and living off of a decent wage that could afford me a small apartment; Even though it's small, it's still very nice and easy to live in, and I dont have to worry about much.     

When I first started working, I had to study how rent, bills and taxes work since I was unfamiliar on how to do those things back then. I discovered they were rather easy and began paying off everything with ease every-time I had a paycheck, never spending money on unnecessary things, and if I ever did, it would only once in a while, like a small Christmas gift for myself because I don't have anyone else around to celebrate holidays with.     

With bills and school on my plate, It began to become a hassle and I then taught myself how to become a responsible person without the aid of those around me, but it is rather difficult balancing school and working at the same time, because of exams and studying and having to pay all of my bills on time.. It's a real pain in the a** if you think of it, because it is like I am an adult that is trapped in a students body: I'm someone trying to pass ninth grade and attempting to find out what I want to be in life, but i'm also an adult during the afternoon and most of the night-time, working for long hours each day, even more when I need to stay for overtime to clean the place up, wash the dishes, and of course keep many of the desserts and food in stock by making them myself with the help of a co-worker.    

Whats even worse is I have work a couple hours after school, not directly but somewhere in the afternoon.. I technically can work with such a schedule, but I usually forget the part where I had forged all of my documentations so I would have to be working for a long time, and for the rest of my dull life- I oftentimes have nightmares that they find out about my forged documents, but after a year with them I can technically say that they didn't suspect anything from them-  

But enough of my stupid monologues! I gotta get ready for school! I can't be late again, no?  

Crappp.. that sweat from that small nightmare I had made me smell weird.. Aaagh.. Groossssss! Now I feel like someone drenched me in salt water mixed with other unpleasant scents..   

Aaagh.. Why does this always happen to meee..?!    

I always get dirty after working such long shifts or having a nightmare..   

It's always so much sweat too.. practically drenching my shirt..    

Well then, I better go shower now. I can't fall asleep again and then be late to school..   

or even worse, being late AND a sweaty mess, and be the butt of another joke in school.   

I quickly got undressed as I was already in the bathroom, speeding towards the shower and turning it on almost immediately- My puffy brown hair immediately being more flatter than an ironing board. Why does water even do that? I like my fluffy hair.. It takes so long to dry and puff back up again unless if I scrub my towel hard enough on my head.. As soon as I felt the then cold water touch my skin, I instantly flinched: Why is it so cold?!  I put it on the hotter settings but it still comes out like it had just came out of an icebox! Brrr... I hate it so much!   

Though.. as soon as the water became a nice and warm temperature, I felt relieved.. My muscles in my body had eased up and I let out a sigh of relief. As the minutes passed by, I dimly saw the warm mist that filled the tub as it traveled outside of the tub and into the rest of the bathroom.      

Ahh.. This feels so good.. I can find solace in my showers every-time. They always make me feel like i'm finally at peace with myself after so many years..    

The perk of living by yourself is you don't have someone to boss you around on when to get out of the shower, or even have a short time to clean yourself. Before I lived by myself, when I was showering back then, my mother always told me to get out of the shower after ten minutes when I didn't even get started on cleaning myself yet, but just sitting in the hot water and observing every drop that makes contact with me skin.     

She told me to leave the shower so often, it was to a point where I couldn't even be hygienic, let alone take a shower for the proper amount of time: My hair after had looked like it was covered in oil.. drenched in it to be more specific, and my hair then began smelling like vegetable cooking oil you use to fry foods. It was embarrassing since I had gotten berated for not being as hygienic when I just had parents who were so overbearing with everything I did, and sometimes they'd restrict me from showering for a couple of months.. Even worse was the scent on my body, as it started to become unpleasant: I was covered in dead skin mostly, specifically around my neck and maybe on my face because of how filthy I was to those around me..    

Though after leaving my toxic household, I began cleaning myself much more often because I grew a dislike for being dirty, even when its just a bit of sweat that spreads around my body. I always like to be clean wherever I go, It just makes me feel so much better about myself. The hot water flickering on my skin feels like heaven.. It's so pleasant.. I wish I could stay in here forever, but I forgot water bills exist.. I wish they never did, because if those bills were never invented, I would stay in the small shower all day while imagining what I would want to be in the future when I retire from my job..

Well- speaking about my job again, due to cafe jobs not really requiring any degree of any kind, I got the job as a waiter with ease and due to most of my hard work, I had gotten many raises because I was one of the few who stood overtime and did most of the work, and I was becoming a favorable attendant since I was able to clean up conflicts almost instantly, and managed to keep the café a pretty friendly environment- 

Oh..    

Sh**..   

I forgot about the limited time I have, so I need to get myself cleaned, and fast- Quickly, I got the bottle of shampoo on the shelf in the shower and began scrubbing my body to get rid of the unpleasant stench that my body was full with. Instantly, I felt like a new person, straight out of heaven to be precise- Even though it' will only be a quick shower, the feeling still lasts for a pretty long time, until it wears out: then, I started scrubbing my hair rather roughly instead of going gentle.  

'''*Scrub Scrub*''' I have' to make sure that i'm all clean for the day, haha.. It sucks that I always feel dirty, even when it's always the slightest things that make me unclean, like dirt, sweat, anything that is considered unclean in modern cultures.. I know showering too often can be more of a negative impact than a positive one, but oh well! I think it is normal to feel that way..   

W-wait.. is it normal?   

Is it not?    

Never-mind that!   

The shower always feels so pleasant.. Everytime I step inside, it just feels like a paradise in a bath-tub.. The water-pressure in these small apartments are really good, too. I guess that's explains the slightly high price for the water, so I limit my use of showering at times but I still try my best to remain  as hygienic as I possibly could..      

Lalalalala..~    

I started to make some random noises in the shower, either humming a song or just creating my own melodies that come in my head. It is somewhat enjoyable to do since I need to also entertain myself in the shower by just humming some songs under my breath or making melodies while scrubbing my body with a soft sponge that soaked my body with soap. Scrubbing my leg, I carefully balanced by leaning onto the smooth, tiled wall, nearly covering my upper thigh in soap: The water immediately washed it away and I put the sponge back on the shelf after a few more minutes of scrubbing and seated myself in the bathtub as the water harshly flickers on me.        

I cant wait to see Julie today at school! I have so much things that I need to tell her when i'm there..  

She's the only person I ever talk to since.. well.. Never-mind that. I don't actually have that much friends of mine- A majority of the people in my school dislike me, but I never found out why.. I wasn't sure if it was because of my personality, or how I act around people in general.. but they all don't seem to like me, except Julie, who is more acceptant and tolerant of people than half of the people I go to school with.   

Julie is my only friend, and when I mean my only one, she is the only one. I met her in kindergarten when we were doing a small drawing assignment together and we hit it off there and then because the both of us are the same, but in a sense different since we share some similar interests and hobbies, but Julie has different ones instead of ones similar to mine. I don't like her romantically, but she's the most amazing friend I could ever ask for!    

Whenever i'm off from work, we'd do fun things like explore the town, get ice-cream, go to the park at times, prank call some of our classmates and much more! We practically do most things together.. since.. well.. She's one of the few people that seem to give a s*** about me, and doesn't seem to find me as an oddity.. she cares for me, defends me from bullies in our school, she studies with me, and she even spends all her free time with me. we practically are glued together, or like what some people say, two peas in a pod.    

Never leaving each-others' side, no matter what the cause could possibly be, even if it was a huge argument that we had: We will still come back to each other in the end.    

Not many people seem to acknowledge my feelings, most people don't acknowledge my existence at all.  

They always see me as lesser than them and everyone treats me like a scapegoat for all their- 

Never mind, I don't want to get too ahead of myself in my own past. 

Did I talk a little too much?   

Ah.. S-sorry. My bad.. it's a bad habit..    

I'll stop now.  

I tend to ramble frequently about things for long hours, and I should work on not doing that too often..   

But don't worry, it's not a big deal! I can do just fine without any friends. I'm able to work better and I wont have the need to distract myself with pointless conversations.. I can focus on work more without having friends that constantly bombard me, except Julie of course, I don't mind when she bombards me with texts during work, since I usually mute my phone and check my messages later during my break..     

She'd sometimes show up to the place I work at and would talk to me while I make her a coffee, and we'd talk about new drama that happens at school or talk about personal experiences that we're most comfortable sharing, when the café is not busy of course-  

Wait- What's the time?  

'''*Peering out the curtains to see the clock in the bathroom.*'''  

Huh?  

6:30 AM? Already? It was just 6:00 not even a second agooo... 

Aww crap..  

Since the time's going by fast again, that means I have to get dry and get dressed.. 

do I have to get out of the shower now? 

I wanna stay in here foreverrrr.. It's too relaxing to not leave, and It's going to be super cold when I do leave!  

But it looks' like I have no choice but to leave since I can't risk being late yet again.. I can't have the teacher give me another tardy this time or else I'll get an in school detention.. God, I already had three tardies this year and a fourth one can lead to another long scolding..   

After a couple of minutes showering, I grabbed the towel from the small hanger near the bath tub and stepped out quickly, drying my hair and body thoroughly, then wrapping the towel around my body while I rushed to get my school uniform, lying on the ironing board near the bathroom. I know it's optional to wear them, but most people tend to wear them since it's an easy pick for an outfit.. I'm too lazy to pick a new outfit everyday, it's more of a hassle when I have to chose something new all the time..  

After I got in my uniform, I finished tying my tie and dried my hair off with the towel again, then went back to the bathroom to pick up the clothing thrown messily on the floor to put the in the washing machine nearby, folding the towel on top of the machine to wash it later. When I get home I usually have to do the laundry or deep-clean my house incase if it's a mess.. Especially this time around.   

I quickly sped over to my kitchen and open the cupboards, looking for something quick and simple to eat for the day.. Inside there was raisin bread, some cereal and a bag of oats. Shoot.. I should have went grocery shopping the day before but I haven't received my check yet so I was unable to spare anything.. It always takes so long for the checks to come in..  I checked in the fridge to see if I had anything in there: Only a half-full gallon of water, a tub of cream-cheese, some grapes and a carton of milk with some peaches lying around.  

Well, this is not that bad as I anticipated it to be! At least I have some things to work with, like cream cheese to make a sandwich with, and just enough water for me to drink- So then, I guess today's meal for the week is a sandwich with a glass of water! I grabbed the raisin bread from the cupboard and the cream-cheese from the fridge, retrieving a small, plain-white plate from the other cupboard that holds all the dishes. 

I took out two slices of raisin bread from the package, then flicked open the cream-cheeses lid from the container, then from the drawers I took out a butter-knife to spread the cream cheese on one slice of bread, placing the other slice on top. Tada! a cream-cheese sandwich! One of my favorite meals incase if I'm hungry~ I don't know why, but it's always so filling and good.. I can eat so much of these sandwiches in one day! 

I walked back to the cupboard and got a small cup that lied around the shelves, then heading over to the fridge to get water and poured it in the cup, putting it back in the fridge soon after. 

I sat down in my dining room and began eating the rather simple meal I prepared for myself. Even though it was simple, its still so tasty... Goodness, whoever made raisin bread needs all the praise they could get,  because they never fail to make it so good..! Especially the ones with cinnamon mixed inside of the bread, it makes the taste of the sandwich so much better..   

'''*Nom Nom*''' So.. hungry..   

It tastes..  so good.. I feel like i'm in heaven already~  

I felt like I haven't eaten in days at this point..   

It could be because of all of those shifts i've been on lately.   

Though, it's good that i'm off on the weekends from time to time!   

But.. thats rare nowadays for me..   

Since i'm one of the people who deliver orders much quicker, i'm wanted for almost every shift.    

It's so tiring.. But, whatever gets the money flowing' in for me..!   

I wish I hadn't forgotten to make myself dinner last night.. But I was so exhausted after those long hours at work, especially since it was such a busy day.. Serving customers left and right is no joke- It's almost over-whelming at times, but the customers seem to take interest in how quick I am with orders and getting them on the table in time- It did raise my wage by a decent amount, so thats a perk! As long as I'm getting paid, I don't mind my job being too over bearing.   

And now checking my cupboards and fridge, I dont think I would be able to cook myself anything- maybe only eat cereal for dinner with a peach as a small dessert for myself.  

'''*Peering outside the window next to him*''' The weather looks nice today, though I have a feeling it will be oddly hot outside. The sun beaming down on my face when I walk outside is always so annoying and even makes me sick at times.. The sun gives me a headache.. It always does.. So annoying when it gets in your eyes when trying to look up at the sky, or do outdoor sports..   

Oh, I forgot that summer is not even over yet!

Though, I wish it were.. I want to feel the cool breeze on my shoulders, no more having to feel the sickening heat that beams down on the streets almost constantly.. I wish autumn would come earlier, It would be so much better if it started now-

Enough of my stupid thoughts.. I need to go now! These thoughts are what get me in trouble in class half of the time since they always cause me to doze off.. After I put my plate and the glass in the sink, I rushed over to my room and packed up what I needed to school as quickly as I could, then grabbing my phone and tangled ear-plugs from the counter after it was charged. I untangled my ear plugs quickly and folded them neatly in my pocket. 

Hmm.. I guess I'll go on my phone for a little bit since there's some time to spare.. 

Lets see whats new-  

Oh! I got a message from Julie.. 

''hey wrench, I got something to tell ya!"''

Hm..  

She has something to tell me again..  

I wonder what it is this time. 

''"?? What is it, Julie? New gossip?"''

''"noope."''

''"drama between popular kids?"''

''"also no."''

''"Let me guess.. another fight?"''

''"incorrect again!"''

''"Then what is it?"''

''"I'll tell ya at school sucka &gt;:D!"''

''"Aww.. Why not tell me nowww? :(("''

''"It would defeat the purpose!"''

''"What purpose exactly?"''

''"I- Umm- Never-mind that!''

''Anyways, when we're in first period I will tell you.''

''I'll see ya at school, wrennie :D"''

''"You also, Julie :)"''

What does she have to tell me now?   

She always has something new to tell me everyday.. 

Whether it'd be school drama, fights or the latest gossip, she seems to have something fresh everyday to talk to me about. You ask her about any trash being spread around through the halls, she has all of the details. Haha, classic Jules!  

But now, I better get going to school- Otherwise the teacher will kill me for sure since.. But, let's all hope I arrive on time without getting another tardy. 

After spending a few more minutes on my phone, I slipped it in my pocket and plugged in my earphones, grabbing my bag  and went to the front of my door to put on the tan boots that sat near the shelves. After putting my shoes' on and buckling them, I swung the door open and then locked the door outside. Off to school we go! A few minutes after going down the stairs and exiting the apartment complex building.     

Welp, it's best I play music to keep myself occupied when walking. I hate silence.    

I played some music that flowed through my ear-plugs, minding my business and quietly humming the tune of the song I was listening to under my breath. I love listening to music, It's almost like an addiction at this rate.. I just cannot seem to live without it.. Without music, the world feels strange: I feel weird without listening to odd melodies.  

But enough music talk-  

The weather is incredibly nice today, so much better than I expected it to be.  

The sky is pretty blinding with its tacky hue of blue, but still, very nice weather for the first of September.  

Though.. the sun still makes me feel ill as it beams down on my face..  

But at least the heat is not that over-bearing like I had expected, it's actually just fine.  

It's not like the time where it was so hot to a point where I began seeing a heat-haze..  

Haha, I almost fainted from exhaustion that day because of the immense heat outside.. Haha, yikes forever..    

summer, am I right?    

When walking to school and listening to the music still flowing in my ears, I waited to cross an oddly familiar railroad with power-cables neatly lined up with each-other, blending in the crowd with other individuals..   

The school was straight across from a town with a couple turns here and there, making it a fairly short walk.. But I remember this being an old, wide road, and not a set of train tracks with overhead wires that magically appeared out of the blue.   

Hm, thats weird. I don't remember seeing this railroad before, was it just built?   

I remembered this was just an old street where cars would pass by and usually had a boatload of traffic.  

I feel like I've seen this from somewhere else, but from where?  

It does look oddly familiar to me-

Eh.. maybe it was just recently built, nothing too serious: Cargo and transportation is increasing, so surely they must need more trains to transport the goods to other districts, along with countries,  and to carry passengers so they can travel where-ever without having to pay half of their savings on a ticket that flies them across the globe. 

There's always some new construction in the district I now live in, so it isn't that uncommon, but there's no way a train track system was made just now, or even in a few days-  

Meh, its whatever..  

Perhaps Im overthinking again, like I usually do.. 

This has been happening with me much more recently and I can't see to figure out why- They began popping in my head since last year after running away.. Maybe it's just because of me balancing work and school.. I always have to be on time for both occasions and it always causes me to have some stress on my shoulder- well, I'll say a huge amount of stress to be more specific, like a heavy rock that people expect me to carry and be okay when doing so. 

I'm always overthinking about getting laid off or potentially getting fired, and my boss finding out about my forged documents, or having to be late to school on an almost constant basis. I already work enough hours that cost me my hours of sleep, especially on days where it begins to get extremely busy- specifically the weekends, since I hardly get free-time for myself and limited time to rest- Even though I wish I could get more free hours to myself, I still have to work very frequently to maintain my lifestyle, even if it means working overtime- 

As the train quickly passed by, The traffic light turned green and the other individuals around me began walking across the tracks while I treaded heavily to get to school, my pace quickening by the minute. The town I was walking by was eerily quiet, every building was of swarthy colors with high gates with the street becoming more and more narrow. power-cable wires surrounded the area. The saturated blue sky was getting covered by the tall roofs. The clouds covered up the sun and begun  

This is.. somewhat unsettling..  

I know it is just a town where ordinary people live, but it's always so quiet.    

I don't even hear birds chirping..    

I hardly see anyone walking around here, no teens walking to school or adults going to work..     

Gee, even thinking of that gives me the chills..     

This place is so unsettling, It reminds me of a ghost-town..!      

It's like no one lives here..      

It feels like it has been completely abandoned..     

The sound of ravens echoed above my head, seeing them fly in a pack to probably sit down on the overhead wires in groups like they usually do to observe the cars and people walking.      

My heart began pounding, faster than the sound of light. The narrow passageway in the town I was crossing filled me with panic, discontent, all of those queazy and negative feelings, my pace starting to quicken while transitioning from walking to running while hearing the faint squawks of crows that rest upon the overhead wires: But I slowed down in order not to end up all drenched in sweat, like how I was this morning.       

I cant take this place..         

I feel dizzy..         

My heart is pounding..         

And my stomach is churning..         

Bleurgh.. Now these feelings all have me somewhat queazy.         

Why is everything so narrow and crammed together?       

I know it's just a tiny little town where people live..       

But something about it makes my stomach quench..       

It's too creepy..!            

Switching between walking and running, after a few minutes I managed to get away from the narrow passageway and the small, yet somewhat creepy town. My body finally relaxed and I gave a sigh of relief, continuing to walk at a normal pace as I turned on my phone to play music again to ease my nerves..              

Thank god..             

That was a bit tense..              

It was like I was in a horror movie-              

Where the passageway would begin to get more and more narrow until I cant walk any further.             

Now, wouldn't that be scary to you?              

To me, it definitely would!              

After a couple of minutes of walking, passing by small towns and villages alike, I arrived at school, and surprisingly, I arrived on time for once: two enlarged gates situate in the front as an entrance, symbolizing a cage at most. In the middle is a gold crest that is used as a lock so no one can leave or enter, unless you're late, perhaps.   

These sorts of gates always looked so intimidating to me, and I'm still not sure how to explain it..   

They're so tall.. so grand, too.. They look like the gates of a mansion to say the least.. but..    

It symbolizes cage bars, too..     

School is essentially like a prison from what I could see it as: Why do we have to learn so many unnecessary things?    

What am I going to do with pythagorean theorem in the future?    

or using zenith to see stars in the sky?    

Or a better one:    

How would finding Polaris have any use for me in the future?   

I don't even know what I want to be when i'm older!    

I have nothing to achieve in life- not just yet..     

I'm sure i'll find something I take interest in someday..        

Someday..        

Walking on school grounds at last after the quick, yet seemingly long walk, I ripped off my ear plugs and unplugged them, putting them in my pocket and dashed towards the murky green metal doors and opened one of them with the weak force of my hand, rushing inside to get to my first period class as soon as I could, hoping to the gods above that I get there on time instead of dozing off at the bulletin boards and being late.  

Eeee! I cant be late again, not again not agaaaaiinn!  

The teachers' going to absolutely slaughter me if i'm even one minute late! 

Hah.. Gah..   

Why do my classes have to be at the other side of the f**ing hallway?!   

Cant my life just get easier instead of always being a big pain in my a**?!?   

After making it to first period, I swung the door open as it created a loud noise, inhaling and exhaling heavily as my hair looked like lightning bolts had just struck me and my bag nearly falling off my shoulders. "I-Im here..!" I began to fumble on my words. "I-If I was late, I apologize!" I looked up at the others and saw them stare at me, whispering to their shoulder partners while hearing soft murmurs from the crowd.

Shoooot.. 

The teacher put down the book he was reading and gave me an odd glare as he let out a hefty sigh, the other people in the classroom giving me a stink eye or an odd stare to me, laughing softly so I didn't notice.     

I heard people whispering to each-other and chuckling about how I had looked: After all that running, I was out of air and my uniform became somewhat messy. All I could do then was lower my head and ignore it.     

Please.. no tardy this time..     

Please.. I cant get an in school detention..     

Not now..      

Definitely not now!     

"Wren, you're fine." The tone of the teacher sounded exhausted and unamused by my presence and did not seem to bother with me because I came in on time.    

"This time you aren't late, so I'll let you pass.   

Just sit down wherever. Don't be a bother, though.   

Complete whatever work you need to finish."  

I gave a sigh of relief, absolute relief: All I could do was sigh.   

Thank god..   

Thank you god..  

I didn't get a tardy either!   

No in school detention!  

And most of all, I wasn't late!   

Yay me!  

I nodded and looked around the room for a second, trying to decide where I should sit. I began looking around the room until I heard a cheerful, yet smooth and optimistic voice coming from the corner: It was Julie, and she seemed to have reserved a seat for me..   

How kind of her..!  

"Wrennie!" She shouted across the room, pointing at the seat in front of her. "Over here!" Of course, my eyes darted towards her and I walked over to the desk and sat down: Thank god almost every single class I have has Julie in it- If she weren’t in my classes, i'd be screwed.. As the chatting in the class increased, I began drawing little flowers on a sheet of paper that was near the small paper-holder in the classroom, quietly making a rhythm with my fingers in an attempt to occupy myself from all of the murmuring and talking in the classroom.  

It's too addicting to make rhythms with my fingers, especially when i'm bored.. It makes me somewhat happy!

Drawing random flowers on schoolwork and paper too.. I love drawing small petal-like shapes, It always keeps me occupied whenever i'm in a boring class, especially during the morning and in my skills class where i'm able to do whatever work i'm missing, as long as I wasn't on my phone. But, at least I  get to work with Julie! 

I always found first period rather dull to me: theres almost no life in the classroom whatsoever.. Whenever i'm in a bit of a bad mood, I find the class that has the most perks boring and almost draining at times.. Even though it's only a skills class, i'm already tired and exhausted from running and rushing myself to get ready.  

Since classes, especially first period, always tend to start early in the morning, everyone is slouched on their seats, exhausted and tired due to their lack of sleep.. Most people my age nowadays go to parties or spend time with their friends up until midnight even.. I know most outings don't last that long, but it does happen..     

Does it?     

Does it not?     

Whatever.. At this point I cant remember what i'm rambling about.. Hehe..     

But aside from my thoughts, that is usually the cause of their constant fatigue and drowsiness, so they'd only get six hours of sleep. Sometimes, they get even less because they stay up more and they get less hours of sleeping, resulting in their drowsy behavior.    

Man, I wish I would do something similar to that someday: Hanging out with friends or going out in general seems so fun, but if i still lived with my parents, they'd refuse all the way..  they'd rather see me isolated instead of having a social life, trapped inside my room with no one to talk to.   

And of course, my only friend is Julie.. Nothing bad about having only one friend, since you can have one friend and be happy about it! But, I don't have a pack of friends like the popular kids here, or even the time to spare because of my full-time job since my boss would get upset with me if I ever did that.. Even though my boss is a kind man, he would get upset if I tried taking off on a work day..       

As I was drawing, I stopped for a moment to take out my folder to do some homework- It was not really much, just some math work that I forgot to make up and a small reading assignment that was due today.        

My work schedule doesn't even allow me to do my homework in peace..       

I wish work didn't get in the way of everything for me..         

I always have to go after school, during breaks, even during the weekends-         

I don't mind, but it has this sense of pressure that is weighing me down from doing things I've always wanted to do, like go to an amusement park or go to a festival with Julie someday so I can enjoy my life for a little-        

But it looks like i'm going to be working until my older ages as nothing but a café attendant, saving every check I have and putting it in my bank account to save for a nice home someday..           

Somewhere where I can finally live in peace, away from all of the toxicity from my parents.           

Even though I ran away from them, I could still feel their expectations and pressure weighing on my shoulder..            

It's almost like a cold sore that occasionally comes back but never goes away, even when i'm already better..           

For the first few minutes, it was just sheer silence despite the slightly loud chattering in the classroom.    

I took out my binder and started to catch up on some more work, specifically work that was due before but I didn't get to finish it because of work. It was mainly science, english, math, and some other assignments. Math is something i'm unable to do, and I usually fail most math exams or small quizzes, but I do fine on my homework: Other subjects, though? I can pass them with ease. I'm able to complete the rest of my work that isn't math in just a couple of minutes.         

Math always gives me a headache..          

I cant do any form of it besides one and two step equations.          

It's always such a pain in the a**..         

So many numbers, shapes and inequalities..          

Not only that, but graphs too..           

Triginometry is also a big pain, almost failed fourth quarter last year because of how difficult it was..           

God, the graphs are more of a pain than anything.. we don't even need them, unless it's for economic or demographic things.           

I cant even get the numbers on there right!          

Even when I went to tutoring or extra help, none of it made any sense!         

During the next few minutes, I was able to complete half of my missing science work that was due months ago!          

Yay me! Now I have less work to do..           

Well.. not technically. I still have a bunch of essays to finish, math work I need to make up..          

And.. Ah, what else now.. Oh! Some greek work I forgot to do because of my overtime work shifts since it was a special event that night, and required some overtime work that included alot of food and drink making, cleaning.. So much stuff to a point where I nearly passed out due to exhaustion.           

Haha, work, am I right?          

Always' getting in the way of anything I want to do..          

Even my own school work..!         

Aaaah.. This isn't fair.. Why can't I do my own schoolwork in peace when my job is always peering over my shoulder? It's like im being closely monitored by it to make sure i'm on time and working my a** off to make a few bucks to pay everything..            

(Editing)          

I piled up all my work from my folder on my desk and began doing each sheet one by one. On my desk was over ten different greek assignments, nine math assignments, at least six english assignments along with a thick packet full of science work, about three inches thick to be a little more specific. It's partially my fault for not doing the work, but I can't really blame myself either since work had me all stressed out and rent was due very soon, so I have to make sure I do my best to get another raise..            

With about five different pencils and assignments towering over my head, I began doing each assignment one by one at a slow pace. I'm a rather slow worker and I take my time, but I still manage to get everything done without difficulty and I end up having more time for work than my studies, but I always managed to get pretty good scores on each test I seem to take.             

I usually do my things much slower so I can get good grades and maybe into a good university when i'm older incase if I ever decide to attend college, but I don't prioritize my grades so much over everything: I still prioritize work over most of my things since bills are more important than school and having to maintain the way I live is almost essential too..               

The school is not technically aware of my job, let alone me leaving my parents. I had to lie to them saying that my parent's are very busy and they don't have much time to pick up the phone for phone-calls, mainly because I created two false phone-numbers that had automated voicemails to them, with the help of Julie of course since she's a big tech nerd and knows how to make fake phone numbers and how to pitch their voices.                

Julie stood up from her desk and walked over to mine, one hand on my desk and one hand on her hip while I was in the middle of finishing some greek homework that I needed to owe up after two weeks of not doing it because of my grueling work schedule.  

I perked my head up to see her in front of my desk, her gaze as friendly as always, looking back down at my homework and paper with the drawings of flowers, then at her brown eyes.  

Well, At-least I have her to occupy me now!  

I despise half the people here, except Julie..   

Since we're in the same skills class, she can help me with some of my work..  

If I help her do some of her's of course.   

It was a deal we made a long time ago in fifth grade after she helped me with my math homework after I wasn't able to complete most of it on time, and I helped her with her english work due to her not being the greatest in the subject..    

But, let's hope everything goes swimmingly and we dont have to get scolded at by our teachers for not having our work done.     

== II. Julie ==
----''"Oh, hello!"''   

"...''H-Hello.."''   

"''I think you're my buddy for the drawing project?''   

''You know, the one where we would have to draw little animals and present them?"''   

''".. Perhaps..?"''   

''"Wren, right?"''   

"''Y-Yes.. that is me.."''   

"''Well, nice to meet ya! I'm Julie, and i'm your buddy!"''   

''"M-My buddy?"''   

''"That's right! You're my buddy for the drawing assignment!"''

"''Oh.. do you mean a partner?"''

"''Tehe- Yup!"''

"''Oh.. Well, It is nice to meet you, Julie."''

''"Nice to meet you too, Wrench!"''

"''Wr-Wrench?! Thats.. not my name.."''

''"Heheh, calm down.. It's my nickname for you.'' 

''Get it? Wren? Wrench?"''

''"U..Um.. I suppose I can understand it.."''

''"Great! Wanna be friends?"''

''"Friends? You? Friends with me?"''

"''Yup!"''

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''I've.. never had friends before..'' 

''no one in this school was willing to be my friend by any chance..*''

''"U-Um..'' 

''Sure..?'' 

''Pardon my tone.. it's just- I've never had friends."''

''"You've never had a friend before?"''

''"No.. Not many people are willing to be friends with me..''

''and I find it odd someone wants to talk with me.."''

''"Oh.. I see..''

''Well then, I am now your friend!"''

"''Really?"''

''"Yup!"''

''"Alright then, Julie.'' 

''"Let's start with drawing..~"''

Julie is by standard very pretty, ethereal at most.     

She is what people in the school describe as a beauty. Many of the guys in the halls and class talk about their crush on her and how she shouldn't be friends with me and she should be with them- but, I don't mind. She does not really care on what they say about her, but if it's about me she would defend me until she would die of exhaustion by sputtering out so much words in my defense. Thats' why people seem to love her so much: She has a unique charm to her that many girls in the school do not seem to have.   

Julie has these big, brown eyes with a nice, dark complexion and somewhat messy, ash-blonde hair with some brown mixed in her long locks. She too also wears the uniform, and around her neck is an ivory, silver locket that hangs below her stomach and bandages that wrap around her arms neatly with rouge red and black sneakers. She is quite short, around one to two inches shorter than I was, but by definition she is taller than most of the girls and even some of the guys.  

"Yo, Wrennie." Julie casually blurted.   

"Oh, Hello Julie!" I answered softly, my voice being much more quieter than usual. "How are you today?"

"Oh, just fine." She responded casually, letting out a quiet yawn. "Just rather tired. How about you, Wren?"

"I feel great, actually! I managed to wake up early this morning."

"Well, thats good," Julie went over to her desk for a moment to get some bottled water and began drinking from it, walking towards my desk again. "You're usually late for class almost every-day, so it is somewhat surprising to see you here on time.."

We chatted for a little bit, just talking about random things that came to our minds, Whether it'd be school drama or my weirdest work experiences, maybe about the guys that Julie had told off whenever she heard trash-talk about me-

Oh.. right! She told me she had to tell me something.. I almost forgot about that.

"Uh.. J-Julie?" I asked sheepishly, burying my face into my homework out of shyness. 

"Yeah, Wren?" She answered. 

"What was it you had to tell me today?" I referred back to the text message she sent me before leaving the house. 

Julie shook her head and came to realization after a few minutes. 

"Oh, right!

There's a new student that just transferred here!" She told me casually, her voice displaying a hint of excitement despite trying to remain calm about the situation. 

"A new student?" I looked at Julie with a curious gaze while tilting my head slightly.

"Yup!" Exclaimed Julie. "They transferred here a couple of minutes ago, todays' their first day here."

"Oh, Interesting!" I remarked. "What's their name?"

Julie looked at me silently, somewhat iffy about my question, like she did not know how to answer. She always has the answer for most things, but this time she did not seem to know how to answer as I noticed her spacing out.  

"Julie?" I asked, waving my hand in front of her face. "Is there something wrong?" 

Julie then shook her head as her gaze returned to me. "Oh! No no, nothing is wrong.." 

"Its just- about their name.." She began her sentence, talking in a rather sheepish tone. "I tried to find it through school files, but.. there was not a name present when I asked." Julie does some sort of work for the school we go to: She organizes folders and files in the storage room, where they keep data on students, so it was how she got access to the folders, so she knows everything about everyone if that is how you word it.   

"That's strange.." I raised my eyebrow for a moment, looking down at my paper and stared at Julie. " Aside from that, are they in any of our classes?"

"Not that I could recall," She answered. 

"Did you not receive her schedule to put it in the portfolio?" I questioned. 

"No," Riposted Julie. "Not yet."

"How odd.."  

I tapped my pencil on the desk, focusing on it for a little while before turning my gaze back to Julie. 

"Yeah.. but, I bet its nothing too big, though.." She spoke. "It's probably not processed yet." 

"Yeah, it could be that.

Just try not to overthink it, alright?"

"Eh, I'll try not to stress it." She reassured me.   

I had a smiled of relief that came across my face: I hate seeing Julie upset or stressed out..   

It gives me a sense of pain in my heart when thinking about it..  

She does overwork herself sometimes, but I don't want her to stress about something to a point where she'll try to get whatever she needs to do done. 

She's my best friend, and I care so much for her!   

I always look out for her, and so does she.    

Julie and I began speaking a little bit more about random things: Random work experiences I had or school fights that happened for unnecessary reasons. I even told her how I almost fainted on the job. Just news that was rather old, but she did tell me some recent things though- About the new student- We started to talk about them after we ran out of topics to discourse about.    

"Yeah, everyone want's to get to know them," She began explaining to me while I was finishing up my science work. "Even the guys are falling for them despite their plain and ordinary appearance."   

"Really?" I looked back down at my science work. "Do they always do that?"   

"Do you seriously not keep up with the latest news here?" Julie asked curiously.    

"N-No- Not really.."   

"They've always been doing this every-time a new student, especially a girl transfers here.    

They gain their trust and either turn them into a copy of themselves, or use them until they no longer are seen as amusing to them."   

I blinked, looking at her in utter shock and nearly dropping my pencil.   

They really do that?    

That sounds so cruel..       

They only use the new students as puppets..       

To make them seem wanted when they really aren't..        

"Oh.. I.. wasn't aware of that!" I stuttered. "That does sound awful.."         

"Sort of is," Replied she. "They want to do that so they grow in power."         

"They think they're these big and high powered people when they're all just a bunch of wimps." She whispered with a rude tone. "You aren't a wimp though. You're my favorite~"         

I looked at her dumb-founded, my small hands covering up my face, flushing red. "R-Really..!? M-me? Your favorite?" I stammered and fumbled on my words shyly. Julie looked over at me confused, but her expression soon turned into a cheerful one with a giant smirk on her face.          

"Psssh, isnt it obvious?" Blurted Julie, coming over to my desk and putting her long arm over me, using her elbow to squish my face against hers. "You are my favorite! Well, it's obvious since you're my best friend~"         

"Oh-" I suddenly shook my head and stared at Julie, abashed and flattered by how close our faces were to each-other. "That is true.. But-"         

Julie suddenly had a confused face. "But what?" Asked she curiously, her head tilting.          

"I- dont think i'm worthy enough to have a friend so kind as you.." I mumbled, my facial expression suddenly turning more mellow. Julie glared at me in shock and started to shake my shoulders rapidly.          

"Aaaah!" My facial expression changed rather quickly, my mellowed face turning extremely shaken up because of Julie rapidly shaking me, sort of like how a rocking horse would go back and forth.          

"Don't say that!" Julie quietly sputtered to me. "You only say you're unworthy because it's what other people think of you as, but I promise you Wrennie, you aren't unworthy! Don't listen to those b***es who call you that, it simply isnt true!"                    

(Editing) 

The next few minutes of class were pretty simple to say the least.  

When the murmuring in the class became louder, me and Julie joined in on the talking since we stood quiet for a bit of time. While we we're conversing back and forth to one another, after that we helped each-other do some homework together on what we were struggling with: For me, it was with certain math equations that Julie was good at, and I helped her with some ELA homework she didn't seem to understand.  

In ELA, we're observing Shakespeares' writing, and learning about his use of figurative language.   

Julie is not the best when it comes to analyzing Shakespeares' writing.. And she's not too fond of it either.   

She is not the biggest fan of his works, and finds his use of figurative language odd because it is difficult for her to understand.     

She usually prefers comics over plays, and likes stuff packed with adventures, romance and fantasy, even horror too. She had been working on a comic for the past year or so and often uploads it to a blog.     

Of course, she is aware that it was from the Elizabethan era and understands why the language is used in the play, but she still sees it as hard to somewhat understand, despite her high intelligence.   

And I can agree..    

Shakespeare made Romeo so..    

over-dramatic.. And a little bit desperate      

It makes me dislike him more than I already have..     

And all of this dramatic crap for what?   

Not getting the girl he wanted for himself?  

Or- Never-mind, again.   

I can't spoil anything from the play, cant I now?  

"What is this?!" She softly muttered, holding the book of "Romeo and Juliet" in different angles before flipping it back to the front and smacking it down on the desk.     

I peered my head over to the loud bang, seeing it come from Julie's desk, immediately walking over and putting my hands on her desk, seeing her putting her hands on her face and scrunching parts of her hair in anger. "What is it you're struggling with now, Julie?"     

"What does this line mean?!" She softly sputtered in my ear, taking her hands off of her face and letting go of the parts of her hair she was holding onto, flipping her book to my direction.      

"Which one?" I asked confusingly. "Could you point to which one is the line you're struggling with?"     

Julie calmed down, and dragged the book back in front of her, pointing at one line that seemed to have her confused.      

"This one here!" She shouted, her voice not being too loud nor too low, but at a good tone so I could hear her. "This is the one I'm having trouble with."      

"Here, let me see.." I told her. "I Think I'll be able to translate whatever quote in old english." Gettiing up from my seat, scooted over next to her seat and observed the small book that laid flat on the desk, Julie's finger pointing at the following words on one of the chapters:      

''“Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.”''       

"Is this the line you're having trouble with?" I asked her, pointing at the sentence after reading it out-loud in a moderate voice to her.        

"Yes.." She murmured quietly, angrily twirling her long, blonde hair around her finger. "I cant' seem to understand what it means.      

S-Sorry.. i'm just not really-"      

I looked over at Julie, softening my gaze and trying to focus on both the book and her frustrated face.               

"It's okay, Julie." I chortled softly while smiling to her, organizing all the messy papers that scattered across her desk. "We all have our flaws."              

"I need help to identify what it means." She requested sternly with a hint of anger in her voice, still looking at her paper in confusion, her book placed on her desk as the words begin to stare at her. "It's so confusing.. it says to write the sentence out modernly after identifying the old english words."              

"Well.." I started my sentence, taking her book one more time and staring at the quote. I started to analyze each word carefully and looked over at some english notes in my notebook that I still had with terms and definitions in old english.               

"''Hath'' can most certainly mean have..               

and the word ''thy'' is an old english work for you..              

So in conclusion,  the line means "Have had no power, yet upon your beauty."                            

"Oh..                              

Oh! Now I seem to understand it." She reiterated, looking down at her already busted book and then at me. "Thank you, Wrennie."                              

I looked at her, my face flushed and as red as a tomato with a nervous expression on my face. "O..Oh! It isn't a problem, really.." I mumbled softly.                                                                 

"Do you still need help with anything? I can help you with other subjects too-"                                                                

"I'm starting to understand how to translate old english now," Julie spoke. "I think I'll be fine for now. But, I'll let you know if I do need help." I nodded at her and smiled. "Alright, then. Fine with me."  I then turned my gaze away from her and focused on my science work, trying to figure out how to calculate eccentricity without messing it up like I did the last time-                                                                 

It was in an earth science lab we did together, and even though the both of us tried to calculate eccentricity, it came out all wrong and a big mess.. Gee, this lab dragged my grade down drastically.. Luckily, Julie managed to help me on some of it as compensation for me helping her with her english work- She managed to help me measure the distance between the foci- and something else I sort of forgot about..                                                                   

Julie, after a few minutes, did need some help with translating more quotes here and there that I managed to assist her with and she started helping me with some of my graphing homework that I forgot to do last week. It was similar to plotting points, which despite it being easy for most, for me it is rather difficult because whenever I plot the points in the correct order, it's always incorrect whenever it's on a test.                                                                   

"Now, where is the point of (0,4) on this graph?'" Julie asked, her pencil pointing to the graph on the paper. I leaned my head closer, using my eyes to try and find the point before seeing the numbers zero and four. I got my pencil and before it even touched the paper, I hesitated: I was scared of getting it wrong again, even though I believe it is right. After a few moments of just staring and zoning out, I put my pencil on the paper and dotted the point.                                                                       

"Over here." I answered, my pencil pointing at the dark dot on the paper. "Here is 0,4-"                                                                      

"That's 4,0." Julie interrupted me quickly after observing the paper for a mere two seconds. "It's not supposed to be on this side of the graph." She snatched the pencil from my hand and erased my confident plotted dot, putting it on the top of the y-axis on the four. "That's 0,4." I looked at her in disbelief, then decided to count the blocks that were present, and realized that she was right. I looked at her, almost in an ashamed manner and started to shake.                                                                         

"Wh-Whaaat?" I stammered under my breath, my hand still shaking in a sense of being shocked. "B-But its on the four, and it's near zero-"                                                                                                                                                

Julie glared at me for a moment or so and laughed it off. "Well, even though it's connected to the four, it would make an entirely different product, because when your Y value is zero, you dont move up nor down, so it situates on the number that is the X value, but if it's the opposite.." She moved her pencil towards the zero and counted up four, leading up to the dotted area. "You move up four. Do you know why it's wrong now?"                                                                                                                                                

"I- I suppose.." I answered in an uncertain tone. "I- I didn't realize that.." After saying those words, I lowered my head and put my hands on the side of my head gently, ashamed by my wrong answer.. "I'm sorry, Julie.."                                                                                                                                                 

I hate getting answers wrong.                                                                                                                                                 

It's like..                                                                                                                                                 

Oh, I don't know..                                                                                                                                                  

It feels like all the time and effort of working and all that was just put to waste.                                                                                                                                                   

When I feel like I did really good on a test, I end up getting a low score, and it sucks..                                                                                                                                                    

Especially if it was a subject I was struggling in..                                                                                                                                                     

I feel proud when I thought I did the equation right, but it ends up being wrong.                                                                                                                                                    

Why does math have to be this way?                                                                                                                                                    

Looking down ashamed, I wanted to cry at that very moment. I felt stupid that I got the answer wrong without knowing and- well.. I guess you could say that I almost broke down about it. Julie saw my expression and then tapped on my shoulder, my hands off of my head and immediately looked up to see a smile on her face. "Don't apologize, not everyone understands a new concept right away." She assured me, rubbing my shoulder softly. "We can always practice more, you know?"                                                                                                                                                   

Looking down solemnly for a moment, I smiled at her awkwardly, holding my breath for a moment before sighing. "I.. I guess that's right.."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

"Hey, Wren." Julie spoke. "Listen to me.'

ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ wren saetang
[[File:Updated wren.png|left|thumb|378x378px]]













info:

age: 15

pronouns: he/him

grade: freshman

gender: male

occupation: café attendant

likes: talking with his only friend, working, drawing

dislikes: people scolding him, bugs 

ethnicity: thai (🇹🇭) 

small description on wren: 

wren in the old english language means "small bird," and is a kind of bird species he takes a keen interest in and always feeds a baby wren outside of his house.  

he does not live with his parents because of personal issues, but he lives by himself in a small apartment where it is affordable while still working as a café attendant. he does find it difficult to juggle work and school, while also having bills to pay by himself. Even though he is not of legal age, he had to forge his IDs and work papers so he could get a job in order to survive. it is unknown why wren had left his parents, as he never discusses anything with anyone, but i'll say it will be revealed later in the story. 

personality wise, wren is very eccentric, observant yet timid and shy. he can only socialize with one of his closest friends, Julie, who he had been friends with since kindergarten. he is seen as an oddity because of his profound interests and was seen as an outcast for the majority of his life and was bullied heavily. due to having no social skills, he is seen as introverted and has a fear of judgement.      

But, however he has a very bright mind and is fluent in greek, english and thai because of him taking several language classes when he was younger and has been shown to have a decent amount of intelligence, meaning he is not dumb nor super smart like everyone thinks he is. julie describes him having the average intelligence.

info : 
                  
age : 15

pronouns : she/her      

grade: freshman      

gender: female      

occupation : none      

likes: wren, candy, listening to music, socializing      

dislikes: overbearing people, too much school work      

ethnicity: somali and japanese ( 🇸🇴/ 🇯🇵)            

small description:      

julie is a cool character to say the least. i really love her design and shes fun to write about. Her full name is actually julianna, but she would rather be called julie since she does not like her full name too much. Julie is somali and japanese, her mother being somali while her father being japanese: i'm not gonna reveal her past yet until the story further progresses because its something i keep doing with my role-play ocs: i reveal their backstories when they were quite literally never revealed.                            

so, Julie is wrens only friend because she's the only one who accepts his oddities: initially she was made fun of for being his friend but she didnt really mind since she didnt give a f**. In the high-school she usually puts stuff in the student portfolios (aka school files), such as their names, schedules etc so she practically knows everything about everyone, whether it'd be the detentions they had, serious drama, personal life etc.

It all started with the letter. The letter had arrived long before the robbery, and it was there merely to mock, for the detective could do nothing to stop him now. 

After all, he was only able to find it after the fact. 

''To Mr. Watanabe Hiro.''

Hiro himself was shocked the letter was addressed to him. How could a thief know who he was? It could have been chance, but Hiro didn't believe so. He had a theory, and it was that he'd somehow managed to find out that he was the one tracking... whoever this was. 

''By the time you're reading this, I've taken a ruby and a sapphire from the Conservation Museum in the Appondale District, quite obviously, from Jamaa. I do advise you see to such a scene, as by four in the afternoon your boss will call you to check it, and I highly advice you be there already.'' 

Okay, so they knew he had a boss. Great. They also revealed their place, and he could easily go there and find clues. 

First, a drink. 
----He arrived to the scene. It was quiet. The museum was the same as ever.

But something was off.

They scanned the paintings uninterestedly, looked at the garish multicolored floor, and stared at a bat statue. Nothing seemed amiss.

Except there was, and he noticed it after staring for an extended period. The bat statue was missing something, which was noticeable from how there were metal holders in place in order to hold it in.

Eyes. It had no eyes.

== '''Chapter 1 Best Friends''' ==
It... used to be so great... we hung out almost every day, rain or shine, night or day, it didn't matter... Autumn, brought sunshine wherever she went... Also cheered us up when we got down... her sister Summer always made beautiful art... Joey, he was so smart he knew the solution to every problem, Luna they were the second oldest they were always "the leader" taking charge and organizing time to hang out, and... Christopher, the brown Dire wolf he was the oldest he... he was so... nice to talk to he always had the best advice... he... always knew how to make you smile, and then there's me, Jerramy, a blue fennec fox... I was... the youngest, that's all I ever was...

The day we lost Christopher was a day I will never forget, it started out normally we were hanging out at Balloosh... just exploring... But then... a scream... A terrifying scream that never ceases to play in my head... echoing... reminding me... we ran to the source of the noise at the eerie outskirts of Balloosh, and it was... Her... it was Peck... The Bunny alpha... She was unconscious, Christopher ran to get help and told us to stay here, after what felt like hours... She woke up... and... Christopher didn't come back...

Peck told us she "got in a really bad fight," and it "wasn't safe here,"

We told her about Christopher, and she told us that she and the other Alphas would look for him, but we needed to get back to Balloosh. After three days of no answers... Peck came back... and said four words that broke us...

"We couldn't find him,"

Things just weren't the same without him we hung out less and less until it just stopped, I hadn't seen them in years, which made this invitation all the more surprising. I was alone in my den like usual, when I heard knocking, I slowly walked toward the door and opened it, but nobody was there. I was about to close the door when I saw it, a strange black card with gold accents and text... I read the front and stood there frozen for a moment.

"Christopher?"

It was an invitation to a party from Christopher. I stared at the card thinking, was it some kind of sick joke, I didn't know what to do, I finally just opened the card, and it showed a map of Jamaa with a red "X" on the outskirts of Balloosh, it was the same place we lost him. I again stared at it, was I supposed to go here? I debated on what to do when I finally decided to investigate. I grabbed the card and walked back into my den.

I grabbed my sword... I wasn't going back... there... unprepared... I walked back outside and started the long trek to Balloosh...

After an hour of walking, I finally arrived in Balloosh, I was almost there... I looked back at the card to see where the "X" was and started walking in that direction. After a little more walking, I saw Luna, Joey, Summer, and Autumn they were all talking with each other, confused.

"...J... Jerramy.... it's... been so long...." Luna said,

Luna was a Tiger with white fur and purple stripes, they were wearing a Purple hoodie and a moon necklace.

Autumn walked over to me and said, "Did you get one too?"

Autumn, was a yellow coyote, she was wearing a causal orange dress and flower crown.

"This?" I say, holding out the card.

"...How... Could... who did this..." Jerramy questioned confused..

Jerramy was an orange kangaroo he was wearing a white shirt and a green jacket.

"It wasn't me..." Luna responded

"I don't think any of us could have done this..." Summer responded

Summer was an orange kangaroo, she was wearing a brown hoodie and a yellow scarf.

"The best thing we can do is to keep going..." Luna said

Everyone nodded an we starting walking yet again... and... we reached something... an eerie purple manor, it looked old but not weathered...

Before any of us could... say a word... It... the door opened... and out came... him...

"Hello Everyone, are you ready for the party?

He came from a country in war, and was forced into fighting. He learnt fast, well, and was talented. He never really thought much of his world, until he received his first vision. He'd grew to never clarify as to what it was, but it changed him. He turned the tide.

'''Jezalyn Helios''' was a minor character in a Good vs. Evil roleplay. She was the mother of the wizard prodigy, [[Locaster Helios]] and the wife of [[Damion Halloreen]]. She was one of the main contributors in defeating the once powerful army known as the Blood Moon in order for the village of Emeraldine to have independence. 

== History ==
Not much is known about Jezalyn's personal life: As she is a minor character, she does not make much appearances within the series, but is frequently mentioned by Locaster or her husband. 

Jezalyn was born somewhere in Emeraldine during their stages of developing as a village. Jezalyn was described to be a rather bright and optimistic girl, always having a smile on her face and always wanting to learn new things, and was curious about the other kingdoms cultures and magic. She was educated mainly by her mother and multiple tutors, leading her to grow  and  be a very keen intellect when she entered her teenage years. 

Though one morning, a military army known as the Blood Moon had invaded the village after the discovery of Emeraldine having powerful magic: At first, they had stated they wanted to assist in the growth of the village, easing the people's worry and welcoming them with open arms before they had taken over the village and had the main general, Loid, as their sole dictator. Jezalyn had went into hiding along with many other individuals after the soldiers begun taking away the magic from other users to fuel their army, even taking away one of the most powerful users magic without difficulty, and were willing to target more of the magic users in her area.  

The Blood Moon started to enforced strict rules on the village and whoever had fallen out of line would be killed, or if any of them had magic it would be removed from their body system. The Blood Moon had then took away the people's will to express themselves freely, To which was a big belief in the village at the time, meaning that if they ever spoke out against them, they would die. 

As this continued for many years, a resistance had formed with Jezalyn in its center after she had formed it for the remaining magic users in the area. She had made sure every member of hers was fed and started to grow more mature and serious throughout, though she had still remained optimistic and kind. The resistance had begun scrapping the last bits of magic there was to spare from the magic tree for survival. Though, when searching for magic to store, she had found a helio gem that could trap in large amounts of magic and stores it in for a long time. After it was filled up with enough magic, she decided to place it on a book, leading to the creation of the orsella spellbook. 

When realizing the magic was able to function and work as a spellbook, Jezalyn begun practicing the spells from the book until she was fluent at maneuvering and activating the spells, before making the big decision to fight the general Loid in order to try and allow Emeraldine to gain its independence from military rule, something she was planning to do for a long time but was held back due to the risks. After months of deciding and careful planning, Jezalyn took this risk and decided to face off Loid, having the risk of ending up dead or coming back alive, but with the cost of losing her spell-book and natural magic. 

After sneaking outside and intentionally causing a distraction for the guards by dropping the book to create a loud noise, she had managed to defeat them with ease, catching the eyes of the unimpressionable, yet boastful Loid. As she begun taking down more of the guards, Loid too had joined in after she managed to get rid of the back-up to prevent any interference. 

Though, the fight began turning brutal as Jezalyn's injuries began to multiply, starting minor at first but became more severe as the fight went on due to both Loid and her having the same amount of strength and magic. As Jezalyn was nearly defeated and Loid was going to take away her spell-book, she had murmured a spell that had pierced him with multiple shadow vines, killing him. Jezalyn then used another spell to remove the guards from the area and into a far forest, then going inside the headquarters to release the magic stolen from those who had lost their own after a long time.  

After the successful defeat of the Blood Moon, Emeraldine was now independent again and began to grow as a village, never being involved in conflict whatsoever due to its already developing state. Jezalyn, after creating her spell-book, began to improve her usage of magic and started to learn more spells she would use in the future and became rather well known within the community, being known as one of the most powerful sorceresses in the village as many other beginner magic users started to come to her for advice and she started to do more heavy work for the population.     

As the community began to grow and the population began to increase, the military was in the stages of being formed, as they were in need of a form of protection that was not reliant on their magic, as many of the villagers had no experience in combat. Multiple kingdoms had taken interest in Emeraldine and sent troops to form the army, one of them being [[Damion Halloreen]], a lieutenant colonel from the [https://wildworks-writing.fandom.com/wiki/Five_Kingdoms#Elveria Elverian] navy after meeting him at the front gates of the villages, immediately becoming fascinated with him. Both of them matched in strengths, Jezalyn for her intelligence and Damion with his skills from the military.      

The two of them started speaking to each-other and even worked together well due to their similar interests and high intelligence, and the both of them had an unusually good relationship and were sometimes seen doing partner-work with one another and constantly spending time watching the sunset or the sunrise: As their bond continued to grow, they begun having a romantic relationship with one another after Damion had confessed his feelings for her while walking with her in the fields by saying he always had warm feelings for Jezalyn due to her caring for him and Damion doing the same.         

After their confession, the both of them started to work together much more frequently and started to get more intimate with one another and after many years, the two of them had gotten married and were very happy to be by each-others side. According to Damion, Jezalyn and him had many traits in common, such as her intelligence, wit and views on the world. Eventually, Damion and Jezalyn had gotten married after he proposed to her and they had a child together. During her time raising Locaster, she was both his teacher and his mother and took an interest in teaching him about magic.             

== Appearance ==
Jezalyn was a tall, slender woman with dark skin, purple eyes and beige-white hair extending to her lower back, She is sometimes seen with light blue markings around her face and arms, indicating she could have been a faerie. On her left ear, she has two golden double hooped earrings, to which she never had taken off.  

Jezalyn wore a dark purple hat with a lighter purple rimming that situated on the top of her head, slightly leaning to the left side. Around her neck is layers of purple scarves that had some gold designing on them to cover the rest of her body and a light purple coat that hanged on to her back, donning a long, purple dress with frilled sleeves and a detailed skirt, white socks and strapped brown shoes. 

During her teenager years, Jezalyn had waist-length hair with a minor scratch on her face. she wore a simple shirt and pants with a black cloak wrapped around her.
== Personality ==
Not much of Jezalyn is seen throughout the role-play despite being frequently mentioned by Locaster. Though, according to Damion, she was a very hardworking, kind yet understanding woman, listening to others who talked to her and always offered advice. Despite her kind nature, she has demonstrated to be very intelligent and serious: She usually puts her family first before anything else, including her son, [[Locaster Helios|Locaster]] and her husband whom she loves dearly. She has been seen in flashbacks as a loving and educated woman, teaching her son about magic and skills he would need to ensure his survival and worked hard alongside her husband to live comfortably in Emeraldine.

According to Damion, despite her kind demeanor, she has shown to be very determined about something she wants to achieve, either for herself or someone else in her life. She has shown to have a good bond with Locaster and enjoyed teaching him magic and other spells.  

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilites''': Since Jezalyn was never mentioned or seen in flashbacks frequently, it is unknown what her abilities were like: However, according to Damion, he had said that Jezalyn was an extremely powerful sorceress that was able to take on many advanced military agents and successfully get them out of Emeraldine if anyone had tried to conquer with above average physical prowess and extreme endurance when having deadly wounds by Loid and his men. 

'''Leadership Skills:''' Jezalyn, despite being young when the Blood Moon had taken over, has demonstrated to have extreme leadership skills, having the capability to lead thousands of people without difficulty by using an assertive and calm voice to sway those around her without trying to entice fear in others. She has shown to have the capability to lead a crowd of people without having to use fear or her position.      

== Magic Abilities ==
'''Orsella Spellbook:''' After creating it through a single helio gem and a large book she had in her hideout, Jezalyn was the first owner of the Orsella Spellbook, passing the spellbook onto her son, Locaster.  Jezalyn has demonstrated to have mastered most spells, being able to control large spells without much difficulty and is able to carry it without it having to drag down her body due to the amount of pages, around over fourteen million pages that contain powerful and dangerous spells alike. Even when she was younger, she had managed to use large spells without difficulty.   

== Weaknesses ==
'''Overuse:''' Despite Jezalyn not being a demon, her main weakness was overusing her spellbook, which can cause her to have fatigue-like symptoms whenever overusing her magic abilities. If she were to over use it to a certain extent, she, like a demon, can fall asleep for multiple days or weeks. 

== Relationships ==

=== [[Damion Halloreen]] ===
Damion was Jezalyn's then husband before her death. As seen in flashbacks, both of them exhibit a strong love for one another

== Confluence ==
Mercury felt bad. Really bad. 

He'd always been tuned in to people's emotions. He hated when people cried- More than any other person, at least. It made him want to cry too. He practically felt it as his own emotion.

His dad worked in computer repair and in a huge accident, his brother accidentally got electrocuted. He got a mild burn and was crying. The mild burn healed faster than what Mercury thought it might heal in, but Mercury still felt the pain.

And now that his brother's closest friends had died, his spirit was down as well. He couldn't quit, though. He needed to make sure his brother didn't do something stupid and die when he wasn't looking.  

If he became a Beta, though... Would Zenith and Polaroid stay alive? It was hard to think about. He didn't want to think about it. Not since yesterday. Heck, not since Monday. 

Mercury pressed a pillow to his face, feeling his hair turn from solid to liquid, little droplets floating about. He didn't want them to die. It made him mad. Almost as mad as his brother usually got. He took some deep breathes, and the drops fell, dripping onto the pillow and the hand holding it. 

He took it off, and went up the Ètare, and minutes after was knocking at Polaroid's door. After a little bit of bonding, he kind of already knew how to get to him. 

"Polaroid? It's Mercury. Can I come in?" Mercury called. 

And that familiar face opened up. Mercury stepped inside. 

It took about three hours of talking, but Polaroid asked Mercury to come to a sleepover at one of his friends' dorm. Mercury accepted. 

They still had time to spare, anyway. 
----The night soon came, and lights began to be snuffed out. Mercury had prepared a bag filled with things he considered necessary, such as a sleeping bag and snacks.  

Mercury still didn't feel really good, but it felt a little better to know his friend cared for him. His friends had let him in, too, so maybe it was a shot to make even more friends. 

At least feeling what others feel made friendships easier. He had a smile plastered onto his face, and in the slowly approaching darkness, reached for the door.   

"Hey! I'm Vertex Zaragoza!"   

A girl with thick, curly, messy hair and pink eyes outstretched her hand for Mercury to take. And he did.    

"Mercury Mercier. Polaroid probably already told you I was coming, right?" He asked.   

"Yep! Come on in!" She said.   

In the room were three people, not including Polaroid, who did him the favor of introducing them as Damini Axelson, Cyro Zacharias Edwards, and Encelad Rossi.    

The room, as rooms often did when Mercury was there, soon lightened up. And then Vertex decided it was time to tell spooky stories.    

Mercury gave the room one last look.    

It was already creepy enough, with weird goo covering the walls, bed, stools being covered in spines, the armoire having an eye that seemed to be staring at him, but when the lights were off, it was as if he was in the Titanic, and water burst through the walls and floor, and he was covered in it.    

The water was his friend. This wasn't water.    

This was ink.    

"Ten years ago, in my country, there was a war," Vertex began.   

"In my native language, we called it Waene Ukito. It translates roughly to Duality Wave. We call it that because the neighboring country suffered an explosion of some sort, so did we. The King and Queen's chests suddenly expanded, and eyewitnesses state they exploded from the inside out, drenching the throne room." Vertex stated.   

"The current rulers are their children, whose incubators were not blown up, were kept there until they were believed to be safe. Frozen in time, the older one was thawed out a year after, while the younger one, three. However, we fear if they grow older, they may suffer the same fate as their parents." Vertex let out a little sigh.   

"So they sent a teenage girl into the outside world to find a wish. And she tried, and tried. They say she hasn't returned since. They say in the dead of night, in an empty highway, if you see tentacles approaching," The ink started to dance onto Mercury's lap, "And hear heavy breathing, feel it right next to you, right down your neck," Down his neck, "Run the hell away. Drive as fast as you can. Don't go back, because she'll sense you."    

And Mercury felt scared, because he could feel the ink, and looked down and saw it, and with a burst of boiling water, got rid of it.    

"Ow! Do you have any idea how much it hurts to have those cut off?" Vertex said, as the lights turned back on abruptly, and she rubbed her tentacles as they recoiled back into her, well, back.    

"Sorry, I didn't know what they were!" Mercury said.   

"Now ya get how it feels," Cyro muttured.   

"Babe, you and I both know you wouldn't have told that guy off," Encelad gripped Cyro's hand.   

"I know, an' I hate the fact that I didn't! It's like my feelin's suddenly froze up an' I couldn't let out anythin' but a, yeah, it's cool, sure I can handle life without proper depth perception!" Cyro ranted.   

"I know you do. I know you did. You can't change the past. Let's handle the present," Encelad told him.   

Mercury could understand both sides.     

He didn't know what to say, though.     

He felt bad. At least he knew that.     

"Hey, how about we change up the topic? Let's play, uh... Truth or Dare! Yeah. Truth or Dare. It's... I... It's the first thing I thought of. Don't look at me that way." Damini said as the rest of the room stared at her.    

"It's okay. I think it's a pretty good idea. Might help us get to know each other better. Maybe it'll get interesting. Who knows?" Mercury tried to comfort her, even though she didn't really need comforting.    

"Yeah, uh, truth or dare, Vertex?" Damini asked.    

"I don't wanna risk it- hit me with a truth," Vertex said.    

"Have you ever stolen anything?"     

"Many times, Damini. Many times," Vertex chuckled.    

"I- Wow. That's weirdly attractive to me," Damini said awkwardly.    

"Cyro, truth or dare?" Vertex looked over to her right.    

"Truth."     

"Have you ever cheated on Encelad?" Vertex asked.    

"Wh- No!"     

"Just checking. Just checking," Vertex said.    

The game continued, and most of the questions were between Vertex, Damini, and Cyro. Polaroid and Encelad got a few, but nobody seemed to want to choose dare. Mercury usually did, though. There was something rather thrilling about it. Polaroid got one or two truths, but Mercury didn't get any up until a certain point. Then, they asked him a lot, wanting to see what kind of stuff he'd do. He wasn't as bad as his brother, but he certainly had done a lot throughout games in his life.     

"Mercury, truth or dare?" Damini asked, now having become a bit more comfortable with the shark.    

"Dare."    

Vertex leaned towards Damini, and whispered something in her ear, which she nodded to. "I dare you to kiss the most attractive person in this group."          

''"Damn,"'' Mercury thought, ''"Easy choice."''          

He grabbed Polaroid by the gloved hand, and pressed his lips to the other boy's. Polaroid's eyes closed as soon as they did.           

Mercury felt nothing at first, and then it kicked in. He felt like his brain turned into cotton candy, and his eyes exploded into fireworks. Bubbles floated around him, without him meaning to make any, and he felt like his chest would pop like they did when they touched the ceiling.           

He took in a breath. It was only a few heavenly seconds between the parting of lips and the bubbles and them popping. Mercury cherished them.          

"That was, uh..." Mercury said.          

Polaroid tried to say something, but his stutter kicked in so badly, he couldn't pronounce anything intelligible, blush almost making the shadow on his eyes turn a dark pink. He took a moment, then mumbled "Fe-felt-felt good..."          

"Polaroid. Calm down for me, will you? Please?" Mercury tried to calm him down, as he released the wolf's hand. He hadn't even noticed he was still holding it until then.          

"Sor-sorry. I've... Never done that... Ever... It was... How do I-I begin to ex-explain it?" Polaroid said.          

"Maybe you should explain it some other time. I know Vertex started it, but I think she and the others are starting to get bored of this now."          

"Al-alright."          
----Mercury felt his chest rise up, and fall down again. 

He stared into Polaroid's open, narrow, purple eyes. He admired their beauty.

The quiet of the night made them all the more beautiful. The others were asleep, giving him a window of time just to enjoy them. He let his free hand touch the tips of Polaroid's ears, who moved his head up just to get more contact. Thank goodness, because Mercury's left hand was being crushed under it. Polaroid's left hand, however, was resting on Mercury's chest.

And that let Mercury to think about his own breathing. Which led to more thoughts about Polaroid.

Then he thought about Zenith. Something had definitely happened ''that night,'' the night he came over, but it was different.

Zenith was like a wine bottle, and Polaroid like a milkshake. He could enjoy both, and actively wanted them. 

But he couldn't. Because there was no way he could date two guys at the same time. Mercury knew that would be cheating. At least, he was raised to think so.

Slowly, the night changed into day again. 

Mercury did not, in fact, sleep that night.
----Morning came, and so did the dreadful realization that this time, it could be him.

Polaroid was absolutely terrified, and Mercury felt the exact same way. He loved the boy, but he understood he was easily frightened and... really, this time it was quite reasonable.

Mercury knew that this time, he might die. Friday used to feel relieving in a way, because he understood the collective tranquility and emotion over the weekend, but now even the weekend was stripped away due to the future funerals. Then Monday would come along, and the cycle would repeat again.

Mercury didn't like it. But he couldn't get himself killed. He couldn't drop out, because no matter what, Antares wouldn't. Antares would probably get himself killed.

The morning went by. Polaroid snuck kisses from Mercury, and a small interaction with Zenith in the bathroom meant they managed to get in some kissing done before class, not helping Mercury's decision in any way. 

But Mercury felt a bit numbed out. Spirits were at an all-time low in the school. Reasonably. Mercury had to do something.

So he did.

''"Do not feel afraid to reach out to me in the case of trouble, though."'' This felt like trouble to Mercury.

Mercury waited until after Physics to lightly touch Solaris' left arm as he exited the class, who turned around. 

"I really need you help. Think you can ask for some time before we get to Math or... something?" Mercury asked. 

"Obviously. What do you need?" 

They sat down at the desk at the front of the class, with a long seat.  

"I noticed everyone was feeling bad. Like, really bad. I don't think that's very productive since they're gonna be thinking almost exclusively on what's wrong. Do you think maybe we could do something like... a festival or a party?" Mercury remembered the parties he used to go to, how he'd often end up a little better, although that was usually because of the drinks or the guys he'd meet. Not that it ever led to anything, but at least he'd feel good.  

After a small silence, Solaris answered; "I have genuinely never gone to a party. However, I will see to it that something happens. I can agree that most of the school has been thinking whether they or their loved ones will die, and this may distract them, especially when evaluations come around."  

"Oh- Geez- Thank you!" Mercury grinned widely.   

"I suppose it's time for you to get to Math. I, on the other hand, have to stop someone from accidentally setting the school on fire," Solaris frowned slightly more than his regular bitter face.  

"Does his name end with an S, start with an A, and have the letters N-TARE in the middle?" Mercury's grin faded.  

"Perhaps it would be good if you helped. Maybe he'd listen more to his own brother than an authority."  

"That's Antares."  
----Antares felt as frightened as when he thought his father's killer would come to murder him, too.

Judging from the pattern of things, how Anna died to Wren and Wren died to Apollo, he was up to fight his partner. He did not want to fight his partner. 

One of them would have to die, and he didn't just want to die like that. But he didn't want that death for his partner, either.

So he let the fire elsewhere. He was planning to get outside, but it looked like his emotions got ahold of him. He was crying, and that sucked, because it made him feel a bit embarrassed, to do it in the middle of a hallway.

A burning hallway. At least it was better than having Apollo suffer an incredibly painful death.

He let out a little moan, as he felt like his very skin was burning and shriveling off, and knew his hair was definitely on fire, as he was quite mad at Liza for what she wanted. Maybe the pain was just him letting off smoke. Didn't feel like smoke. That made him notice he was breathing in pure smoke, just as if it was oxygen. 

Then the overwhelming heat turned into freezing water, and Antares swiveled around to see his enemy and his brother working together to stop him. 

He'd kind of guessed his brother would have something like his hair, but he never imagined what it was. Bubbles, floating everywhere, bursting as soon as they hit a wall or flame, which was kind of cool, but not as cool as the water pouring from Mercury's hands. A puddle had formed, and it was spreading. 

The water that was washing over Antares had small shards of ice, which told him ice came first, water came next. After going through two extreme temperatures consecutively, Antares couldn't feel much except "pain" and "cold". 

Thankfully he didn't feel like he was drowning. Gills had a purpose, after all, although it was pretty annoying to float around in water for a while.

He let out a couple coughs afterwards, as he still had human lungs and needed to breathe, then Mercury ran up to him with a towel.

"Perhaps it would be best if we sent him something so incidents like these won't happen again," Solaris told Mercury.

"Yeah, maybe. Something to, like, reduce the magic power Antares lets off when he's mad."

"Exactly. I know just who to get. Come," Solaris indicated, starting to walk away from the scene.
----Graham's Workshop was actually under the school, and could only be entered through Ètare. It led towards a giant golden cog-shaped door with many different little cogs on it, leading towards a lock, but with a few blank spaces. 

A table was next to it, with twenty or so different sized and shaped cogs and a riddle on a hanging wooden sign.

Mercury couldn't read the riddle. It was in another language entirely, to make getting towards Graham more difficult.

Solaris, however, already knew exactly which cogs were necessary, and placed them in their respective areas.

Next, there was a silver cog. On its left was a metal and silver sphynx with emerald eyes. It opened its mouth, and a recording of a woman's voice played.

"Eine person, ein rätsel, eine chance. One person, one riddle, one chance," it said.

It stretched out its paw, and Solaris touched it. 

"Ein mann geht nach einer sehr langen party-" "The man goes home in the morning, so he can see well," Solaris quickly interrupted. The door slowly opened.

"They ''are'' easy, it just takes time until you can hear the English translation. I will be waiting at the next door," Solaris said, and left through the cog. It quickly closed shut again.

Antares pressed his own hand to the sphynx, and it played that old riddle with the rooster that laid an egg. He already knew the answer.

"I'm going in there, but I'm not looking at him, or talking at him. Sound good?" Antares said.

"It's cool. Go on," Mercury gave him a thumbs-up.

Antares rushed through the door and before it even closed, turned around to look at Mercury instead of Solaris.

Then Mercury touched the sphynx.

"The bow burnt. The sea rose, and the goat and the man drowned, crushing the fish. The ram charged, but it was too late. The bull searched, and it found its fate. The crab was crushed in the struggle, the lion went missing. The maiden was eaten in its hunger, but fairness decreed it dead. Wild scorpion was crushed in the middle of chaos. Who lived?" It asked.

Mercury knew the others had gotten easy riddles, and maybe this one was experimental or just a glitch, but Mercury felt like it was pretty familiar, and so he went with "Gemini."

The door slowly opened, and Mercury felt both surprised and not at all.

He felt a chill rush through his body as soon as he entered the third room, and saw a bronze cog door. This time, it had a sign bolted onto it, German on one half, with the English translation on the second half of it reading "What would Graham do?"  

A table on the cog's left had a pair of hearts, which didn't look like human hearts, giving Mercury a sense of security he didn't know he needed.  

In the center of the room was a bronze pedestal, and above it was a laser which bounced back from the pedestal making it so the room wasn't damaged.   

Solaris grabbed a heart, examined it, and said in a low voice, "He changes them once a month. I will be reminding him."  

Then, he placed the other heart under the laser, which lowered slightly, revealing a black cube, keeping the laser in place yet letting it move within it, fixing an injury Mercury hadn't seen on it. And finally, the door moved.   

It revealed a large room with many metal tables, shelves, and otherwise areas to hold items which were of course, filled with items. Tools, blades, switches and buttons. A crank was on the wall opposite the gear, and next to it was an operation table with a screen above it. None of the parts that seemed to turn on, were on.  

The last wall had a door labelled ''"Do not enter unless with explicit permission: Private Testing Room with EXTREMELY DANGEROUS experiments. Radioactive experiments are sealed further inside. Failed experiments may be discarded here."''   

Out of that door emerged an old man with white hair, slicked back with hair gel, messy and with cogs and screws tangled in it. He had a big nose, and thin lips. Time had done a number on his body, with wrinkles changing his face as he took breath and blinked his brown eyes. These had a pair of working goggles over them, with two lime green circles around his eyes.    

Matching these was a workbelt wrapped around his lower waist, holding multiple basic tools. He wore a plaid, light blue long-sleeve, black pants, and brown boots. His back was hunched and his knees wobbled a bit, but a pair of braces over his pants he walked with the help of these, and judging from the small "G" on the left leg, were made by him.    

Finally, wrapped around his lower ribs were two pieces of metal that pressed tightly against his skin that connected to a black box with three holes on each side, adding up two fifteen, occupying much of his back.     

Antares had a grin on his face. Mercury did too, but his was much softer. He understood this was Antares' favorite teacher, but Mercury didn't care too much. It was just another teacher. Solaris would probably understand, as he did work with them. Maybe it would be cool if they talked more.    

Then again, Antares wouldn't like that. He also didn't like Zenith, reasonably, but they interacted in secret, so... Solaris didn't seem to like Antares, either. Mercury could feel it. He was just there because of his duty, not because he wanted to be.        

"Hello, Graham," Solaris said.        

Graham moved his hand as if to say "Wait," and then moved towards the crank, twisting it for a spin or two. The room lit up due to the screen and operation table turning on. He moved towards the screen, and as soon as he did, a keyboard popped out of it.         

The screen had a few dozen light green squares over a dark green background. When he clicked on one, they changed to slightly darker green, and the process repeated once more. Then a light green line appeared in the middle.        

Graham typed: "I'm very sorry. I am currently experimenting with mouth technology, and therefore cannot speak. Please excuse my silence and tell me what's wrong."        

"Ah, alright," Solaris said. "Allow me to explain the situation."        

"You stay quiet if you know what's good for you," Mercury whispered into Antares' ear.        

"Think I'm ''that'' dumb?" Antares whispered back.        

"This little nitwit-" "Hey!" Antares interrupted angrily.        

"Who lacks a sense of responsibility has been blowing up at school. In both senses of the term. Thrice did he threaten, in a non-verbal way, to burn the school without success, although the most recent attempt, a few minutes ago, came close, which is why I believe it's time to seek greater measures," Solaris explained.        

"Is this a reward?" Antares joked, recieving a lightly annoyed stared from Mercury.        

"Okay, I have an idea. Give me five minutes alone with the boy. I will need him to take his shirt off as I require access to the area," Graham typed.        

"Well," Antares said as he quickly took off his shirt, revealing the bandages covering up his gills and his back tattoo of a dragon, "I'll be seeing you."        
----When Antares woke up, he had his shirt back on. He also had a collar around his aching neck, with spikes around it.

He also had a bit of pain on his chest.

Graham had typed out a message. A long one.

"The spiked collar is called a Magic Minimizer, MagiMin for short. It helps make sure you do not go excessively on your magic. Twisting the front spike will let you use your full ability. Twisting the back spike will let you take it off."

"The pain in your neck comes from an extender. It helps to make sure it links you as a core of its energy. Without the extender, it would not work."

Antares understood, and really, had no strong opinions. Maybe he'd feel differently later. For now, he had PhysMa. And he knew he might die.
----It was a cycle, and Mercury was aware of it.

He perfectly understood Antares for being afraid, because he felt they might pit them against each other. Pick a twin, he tried to joke to himself, knowing the morbid reality of the scenario.

Mercury definitely didn't want to hurt Antares, considering how his powers would either result in a painful death or a gross death. He also didn't want to die, considering how Antares' powers guaranteed a painful death, either by suffocation or burning. Plus, since they both knew each other's strengths and weaknesses, they'd either both play dirty and kill each other or just balance each other out so well, neither of them would be able to beat each other.

The cycle was simple. They started with Anna, and got to Wren. They got to Apollo through Wren. If Antares beat Apollo, they got to Antares. Antares to Mercury.

Mercury didn't want his brother to die to Apollo, but that felt kind of like a death wish. So he tried to convince himself of a hope that maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't come to them killing each other.

"Is your neck okay?" He asked, as they ran through the castle to get to class.

"Hurts. But it wasn't cut off, so I'm good," Antares dodged a statue of a giant head of some guy, and slid into a portal, Mercury following.

A few minutes later, they finally arrived at the stadium. Sitting on some seats near the ring, Mercury sighed, knowing what time it was. He hoped like hell nothing would bring Antares inside, yet a familiar face did.

Polaroid sat next to Mercury, and whispered in his ear those words he dreaded.

"I'm really, really sorry but, um... your brother... he-he was chosen to fight a-and he needs to go down the arena because... well, I asked the professors t-to let him have a few minutes to talk with his opponent and... y'know... I don't want to be the messenger h-here so..." He stuttered.

"...Okay. Thanks for telling me." Mercury grabbed Polaroid's hand and turned towards Antares.
----The room below the arena was dark red, with a wooden floor. It had a few beds, but mostly chairs. Lots of brown metal chairs, stacked together.

He pulled one out and sat on it. His mind was blank. He should've been thinking about something, anything, but... He just couldn't, and stared absent-mindedly into the wall.

Antares didn't know who his opponent was, but his stomach dropped when his suspicions were confirmed.

His own partner.

Apollo came into the room, trembling, and sat on his lap. The look on their face said both "I'm scared," and "I'm sorry." Antares pressed his index finger to their lips, and then pulled them in for a kiss. 

Then another. They melted into each other, passion mixing in with panic and the knowledge that one of them could die only intensifying the moment further, hearts pounding like the drums in a metal song. Antares placed his hand on Apollo's back, pressing them closer to him, pulling away only for air. Antares couldn't bear to lose Apollo, and yet these kisses weren't like a promise to see each other, but a goodbye.

They only stopped when Ms. Muriel told them they were starting to become late to the games, with a somber look on her face, and Antares knew that'd be the last time he'd ever feel Apollo's lips on his. 

They went through the wooden gate and onto the field. 

The sun was brighter. The people, with grimmer looks than ever. Antares had, but hadn't expected to be in the ring so soon.  

"Uh..." He tried to fill in the silence. 

''"I love you,"'' Apollo mouthed. 

Antares smiled warmly, despite the blare of the horn, despite what he knew would happen, despite everything. 

He unfastened the front spike on his MagiMin as Apollo made themselves a katana and a shield. 

Antares' mind clouded. He dodged swing after swing, knowing Apollo was much more versatile magic-wise. He knew how to dodge a punch and how to throw one back, but Apollo was... just so strong. 

He loved his partner, and felt bad. He knew he'd probably die, and hated the thought. He probably wasn't panicking enough. He never did. 

He watched as Apollo prepared himself for flight, and felt his heart beat. 

It was beautiful. 

He had to destroy his prismatic angel. He felt like his organs were pushed into a blender, and his mind in a jar, and he was gonna stay alive because of that, and suffer because for some reason his nerves were still in the blender... It didn't make a lot of sense! He didn't want to hurt Apollo... 

The emotions were revolving around him, and he felt like he was being pushed to the limit. His hair started to smoke.  

He felt like a piece of wood, and he was lit.  

So he took out the flame. 

It landed on Apollo. 

Apollo screamed. The flames only attacked the left half of his body, non-spreading, and Antares froze. It was as if his body just shut down. He thought to himself to move, to do something, and he couldn't. Pale skin turned dark, to blackening. Pieces of skin fell of his arm. His voice rose an octave.  

Then he fainted, the flames dying, leaving his damaged skin. He wasn't bleeding, and had been screaming out of panic, but Antares finally snapped out of it, and rushed towards his frail body. 

He heard through the loudspeaker a message of congratulations, but tuned it out.  

There was something more important to him. 

Apollo was still breathing, yet Antares had won. 

== Vulnerable ==
Solaris couldn't nearly begin to describe how he felt, but his mind told him he had to, just to get a grasp over it.

He felt ''helpless.'' Helpless and inadequate. He had the ability to do some stuff, but he couldn't really speak his mind about any truly important issues, such as the games. Yet he had to do so much work. He didn't have any control over what was happening around him, and even though he was a bit of an authority figure, it definitely wasn't enough.

He'd been talking to Mercury for a bit. "Antares feels pretty distraught," he'd mentioned. "I don't know what would be good for him... can you help out?" He asked.

He said yes. Not because he was actually too concerned- Antares seemed to have taken the deaths pretty easily- But because it'd make him look good. Solaris didn't feel too bad about that. He needed to do it, and he would. 

He went towards the Merciers' dorm, and knocked twice on the door. Mercury opened it.

"Antares is taking a nap. He's been doing that a lot lately," He explained in a soft voice.

"It makes sense. Can you wake him up for me?" Solaris asked.

"Alright. Don't feel bad if he swears a lot, by the way," Mercury turned around towards the bed.

Antares woke up with a face full of water. Which sure was a method. 

"Fuuuu... what time is it?" Antares asked. 

"It's Sunday. Does it matter?" 

"...Yes?"

"Seven in the morning," Mercury took a glance at a clock on the wall next to their bed.

"So why the hell are you waking me up?" Antares groaned.

"You're a wreck. Go fix your problems," Mercury stated.

"That's rude."

"That's tough," Mercury put his hand in the shape of a gun and started to squirt a bit of water at Antares.

"Alright! Alright! I'll go!" Antares exclaimed and scrambled out of bed.

Solaris waved, although the wave was stiff.

"...Hell no," Antares quickly said.

"He's gonna take you to talk with Apollo. Like it or not, Anty, like it or not," Mercury told him.

"...Damnit, man!" Antares huffed.

Solaris got out of the way and extended his arm with an edge of chivalry.

Antares followed, extremely annoyed.

"...I don't feel ready," Antares mumbled after a few Ètares and a bit of walking. Solaris understood completely. He ''was'' in the same arena, after all, and Antares was in the front line. He practically froze with shock that day. Solaris noticed it. It'd be sadistic to dismiss it.

"You couldn't. But at the very least, they're alive, and most likely waiting," Solaris tried to calm him down. It probably wouldn't work, though.

"I feel like I'm going to be executed," Antares said.

"I know. I also know you are an idiot with anger issues and do not need insecurity on top of that. Isn't closure important to you?" Solaris asked.

"...F***, you have a point there. But I don't want to raise your ego, so let's pretend I didn't say s***," Antares smiled a little.

Solaris covered his mouth to obscure a small smile, which Antares didn't notice.

As they got closer to the hospital room, Solaris felt the air get hotter. He stopped Antares by grabbing his shoulders, which made the boy turn his head away awkwardly, and turned down his Magic Minimizer. Graham had warned him to do so.

"Sorry, man... I, uh..." Antares mumbled.

"Idiot. Be glad I was here, and remember to turn it down," Solaris scolded lightly.

"F*** you. But yeah, I am kinda glad. I'm just not used to it," Antares said.

Finally, they reached the door to the hospital. Antares let his hand rest on the knob, hesitant to turn it. He looked at Solaris, a bit expectantly, yet the worry was still plain to see. Solaris thought this was... Actually, kind of cute. He wouldn't admit it then and there, and besides, he was starting to feel a little bad. Antares acted strong, and brave, even if he was hasty and foolish, but seeing him in such a state hurt. Just a little.

So Solaris gave him a little nod, both of encouragement and of approval of the action, and Antares twisted the knob.
----Bandages covered most of Apollo's left side. The few bits that Antares could see were grisly, pasty and paler than his usual skin. Antares could see a little bit of red, and felt disgusted- Not at Apollo, because this wasn't their fault. This shouldn't have happened to them. He felt disgusted of himself, of his own magic. He wished he'd just stayed at a normal school so he wouldn't feel this way, get in trouble, maybe expelled once or twice, and finally get stuck in a dead-end job.

That would be better than this.

Apollo was sleeping, so Antares reached to cup the part of their face that was burnt, and whispered into their ear some simple words; "Babe, wake up. I gotta tell you something."

Apollo's available eye opened wide, fast. "Oh- oh god..." He mumbled, scared.

"Babe, it's me. What's wrong?" Antares asked.

The two stayed silent for a minute. Solaris didn't understand what was going on, for once. He wanted them to communicate already.

"...I, uh... Third degree burns, huh?" Apollo chuckled weakly.

"Yeah... I'm really, really sorry. I just kinda froze out there, and I couldn't control my powers, and then..."

"I can't do this anymore," Apollo sighed.

"...What?" Antares asked, trying to confirm what they just said.

"I can't do this anymore! I got f****** destroyed out there! I don't know what could happen if you lost control again and f*** it, you definitely would! I need someone who'll take care of me now, and knowing you, you're not the guy! I'll get rejected in most places because of my appearance, and knowing you, you'll probably end up not getting a job until you're twenty-six! Our lives would have been s*** anyway!" Apollo ranted.

"I know, but we could've made it! Rationed food, shared an account, whatever! I'm not as senseless as you might think!" Antares exclaimed.

"And now you put words in my mouth! I don't think I'll ever see a candle in the same way, and I'm gonna have to transfer schools after this since my parents don't want me to be here! We knew we were gonna die, and this was way worse, and I can't take it! I'll stay in the hospital for the next few days, and then I'm leaving this place... This wonderful, horrible place," Apollo's voice went a bit more quiet on that last part.

"...I love you," Antares said.

"I-I can't say the same anymore," Apollo said shakily.

"...C'mon, Solaris. Let's get out of here," Antares said, looking at the man in question.
----Antares was pretty quiet. Solaris didn't know whether to bring him back to his dorm or somewhere else, and Antares was walking aimlessly. 

Then he froze.

"What's wrong?" Solaris asked, genuinely worried.

"I just got dumped," Antares said, realizing what just happened.

"I thought you were taking it quite well," Solaris tried to reassure him. 

"I'm pretty sure you've never been in a relationship. This is... my friends got killed and my partner doesn't want me anymore... I... If this keeps happening... I need to get a grip," Antares started to walk again. Solaris followed.

"I told myself I wouldn't let you see me like this, but... I guess it just kind of happened and... ah..." Antares let his hand wipe away a pair of tears from under his eyes.

"Let it all out. I'm the person least likely to tell others in this school. I lack the desire to, despite how I may feel about you," Solaris tried to calm him down.

"F***... It's just suddenly hitting me all at- at once and... I can't take it! I just... I know I'm supposed to be the strong one but I can't... I've got no control over the situation and there's nothing I can do and I hate it! I hate it! I hate it so, so much!" Despite the MagiMin around his neck, Antares still managed to let out some sparks. There were a few tears starting to drip now. 

"The one time I can do something, I mess it up, and now I'm single again... Took a bit to get over the last guy, I-" Antares suddenly quieted down for no visible reason.

"I don't know how to help. Let me do my best effort. Come with me," Solaris said in the calmest voice he could muster.

Antares did.
----Solaris brought him to the piano room. He'd never played for another human being- Sure, his pet rat, Deimos had come up here with him once or twice, when he wasn't roaming around his cage, but apart from him... 

The room was coated in beige paint. He knew it used to be a mucky shade of brown, which he liked to think was because they'd run out of nicer colors, and he tried to choose one that fit the environment. As Solaris began to play his beginning scales, Antares looked at the many books filled with musical sheets. Solaris could have told him what any of them contained, but they both knew Antares would only bore himself if he asked.

Then, slowly, Antares moved back towards Solaris, and sat next to him on the stool. "I do not know if this will help, but-" "Anything that takes my mind of him helps," Antares interrupted, staring blankly at the wall.

"Okay," Solaris looked at the keys, and began to play. He chose Moonlight Sonata, first movement. It was overdone. It didn't matter. It felt appropriate.

Antares didn't feel anything. The chords were strong, but he couldn't feel their weight affect him. His eyes, almost forced, dragged themselves from the wall to Solaris' hands. He admired the strength yet agility within them. It was different from him and the guitar. He occasionally snuck glances of the man himself, who was in some sort of trance, concentrating fully on the song.

Damnit. Solaris wasn't being mean for once, which was cool, but it didn't really matter, because it didn't change the feelings in him. Antares thought of many things, only to find his thoughts running back to his ex-partner. It hurt. He'd only dated him for a week. A f****** ''week.'' A single incident ruined what could've gone on for months, years, or maybe even until death did them part. It might've been better if Apollo would've died, but he probably wouldn't have taken that well, either. It felt like they'd known each other for years.

He felt lost. He felt lost and he couldn't find a way to be free. He didn't like this at all. 

After a particularly quiet moment, Solaris spoke up; "What about Mercury? Has he not helped you in the slightest?" 

"I mean, it's just... I don't want him thinking any differently of me. I don't want to go see him right now, either. Apollo and I started our relationship in my dorm, and I guess it probably wasn't a good idea to stay there, knowing that. Really affected me. This all happened in a short period of time, and I haven't checked the bulletin board because I know Mercury and I are probably destined to fight someday..." Antares didn't know why he was telling Solaris all this. 

"I'll try to make sure you two do not need to fight," Solaris nodded. 

"Okay. Thanks. I don't know where to go right now, though. My friends dying and all," Antares laughed a little. The laugh wasn't genuine. 

"I'm sure Polaroid can take over my duties for the evening, so why not come to my room? Sleep there for the night, I couldn't care less. I will be studying, so as long as you don't bother me, you could just... Actually, my room is surprisingly boring for anybody other than myself. I'll try to get a television or some other electronic device to keep you entertained. I was never particularly interested in that sort of thing," Solaris offered. 

"...Yeah, I'm up for it. Is that, like, a way of saying you wanna hang with me?" Antares smirked. 

"I don't consider it hanging out if I'm going to be ignoring you. I consider it giving you refuge," Solaris rolled his eyes. 

"Fair 'nough. Take me there," Antares got up. 
----The first thing Antares noticed was the fact that this dorm was huge. He knew Solaris and Polaroid would probably receive a little special treatment, but didn't expect nearly this much. He could reach the ceiling if he jumped from his dorm's bed, but he'd need to climb onto the large structure that held Solaris' bed and then grow twice his size just to be able to reach it.

Then, he saw the windows. Or wall. Window walls. "If a hurricane happened, Liza's magic would protect us from it. Although, I am not so sure about that considering what has been going on recently," Solaris said, noticing where Antares' eyes were focused.

"That's... cool," Antares said, not really knowing how to react. Then, it clicked. He ''had'' to ask Solaris about what was going on. Maybe they'd gone to his room just for that!

Antares glanced at the coffee table with books on it and a potted plant and the large sectionary sofa around it which was like a square without one side, and then looked at his desk with books and a lamp on it. It had a black swivel chair tucked into the kneehole. The large cage on his left with the rat from a few days ago in it. 

His bed was neatly made, with white sheets and two matching pillows, and its canopy held white curtains and candle holders on the posts, which were low enough they didn't burn through the curtains but high enough Antares knew Solaris probably had to use some sort of tool to reach them, even if he was taller than him. 

"The television will appear in a few hours, at most. Liza is currently busy dealing with a previous request of mine. In the meantime, I actually do not know what you could do, as our interests are very different, and I've been busy researching on... something," Solaris said. 

The room had a door on its right wall, almost near the corner, and bookshelves where Antares had come in from. "What's in the door?" He asked, heading over there in case he told him to see for himself.

"A telescope. It's quite large. There's also more bookshelves in there and a fridge in case I get hungry. I do not actually eat much, though," Solaris' eyes were focused right on Antares, giving him the familiar feeling of them burning holes into him.  

"So what would you like to do?" Solaris asked, noticing Antares being frozen in place after a few minutes. 

"I'm curious about some stuff. I mean, we all are, but... There's nothing else to do, is there? Can I ask you about what you know?" Antares felt like he was being forced to be nice, but it wasn't that bad.  

"I understand why you'd want that, all recent events considered. Alright, come over to the sofa. Maybe if we waste a bit of time, you could get something to entertain yourself afterwards, this being a magic school and all," Solaris sat down on the right side, on its middle cushion. Antares sat down on the middle seat, middle cushion.  

"Alright, so... I guess I just wanna know anything you know. I really don't wanna admit this s***, but you're smarter than me, and way closer to the alphas. I kind of assumed you'd know... something! Anything. Goddamn, we're all just suffering with this bull and we can't do something about it? That's... f****** awful," Antares said.  

"I know. That's why I must tell you everything from my side. I only wish I knew more," Solaris sighed.  

"It's cool. Anything helps, really. F***, even if you say the most slightly... what's the word for when something's related to something?" Antares asked.  

"Relevant," Solaris replied.  

"The most slightly relevant thing, I won't give a s***. I just wanna hear it," Antares finished.  

"Alright, then. I owe it to you. First off, it came as a shock not only to myself, but to all the other alphas when Liza declared the competition. It is, in fact, the first time she's ever been so reckless. I wouldn't have expected it, such an inhuman task. She has influence over the magical world, being so powerful and a war hero, so she probably obscured it from the government, or made sure this was entirely legal without any liability over the kids' deaths. Which sucks, because the parents deserve at least that much," Solaris began.  

"Last year went by quite slowly. Boring, even. She promised she'd shake things up a little, but violence should not be considered shaking things up. More of a 'throwing rapidly across a room'. Although there is a bit of thrill to the idea of a competition and some may find the danger enticing, apart from that, the school's magic has been functioning slower and slower. I believe it is being drained. Normally, a television would have-" A small crack was heard, and a flat-screen appeared on a small table in front of Antares, filling in the square the sofa made, the remote on the coffee table, "-appeared by now."  

"But as you can tell, it took a while to come up. If this keeps coming, the school will barely be able to function. I worry about the shield coating it too. If it fails, and danger approaches... Well, it was made to withstand invasions, so I think you get the message," Solaris' hands moved as he talked, kind of filling in the blanks.  

"The school would go kaboom," Antares concluded, nodding.  

"Yes, it would crumble. Now, I believe, and this is just me theorizing as I've heard a bit and been able to ''attempt'' to piece things together, but couldn't possibly know what is actually going on, that she will not give people a chance to escape once they take on the quest to find the Cube. I do not know what the Cube is. If it was genuinely important, I do believe I should have! So it must be important to her. If the champions escape, I believe she'll try to bring in the authorities, or use her magic against them. She must be picking them off in order to see who's the strongest so she can know who'll be able to survive the quest," Something in the way he spoke told Antares that he really did just build this from what he'd heard. Antares felt slightly impressed, but didn't want to admit that.  

"I also believe she wants the winners to prove themselves. I do not know if the Cube has any properties she wants, but perhaps it is more of a McGuffin? If I'm right, then I believe the reason as to why is to make an army, or bodyguards. Something that can offer her protection."  

"I do know one thing. We cannot leave campus and escape. The forest counts, but after that, we're blocked off. It was implemented as a security measure years ago, but because of all of this, now I think of it as a jailing system. Liza must be using this fact to make sure anyone in the competition can't leave it. The trial period is over too. Even though most people left during all this, the people who remained are locked in. They're stuck into the cycle of battles now, and even I can't stop it," Solaris wrapped things up.  

"God," Antares mumbled.  

"I know," Solaris replied.  

"F***!" Antares exclaimed.  

"Calm down," Solaris said.  

"Sorry. We're just cows for the slaughter, now..." Antares looked at Solaris hoping that wasn't the case.   

"That's right. Only a god could win in combat against Liza," Solaris said grimly, confirming Antares' fear.  

"I... I'm gonna stay here the night. I don't feel safe anymore," Antares admitted.  

"It's okay. I'll be studying. Go ahead and watch whatever, I'll just wear earplugs," Solaris replied, trying to make sure Antares did feel safe.  

"Thank you," Antares said in a quiet voice, and turned on the television.   
----The second time Solaris ever played for another person came later that night. Antares had soon drifted fast asleep, and while he knew Polaroid might be able to handle taking care of the school, he also knew Polaroid could get scared quite easily, and decided to double check and see if he'd done everything properly. 

When he did resolve anything Polaroid hadn't, Solaris checked up on Antares. Seeing him sleeping calmly with the TV playing, he knew that he didn't have to look out for him at the moment. Solaris had spent most of the day studying or working, save for the few minutes he'd spent with Antares, so he thought it was a safe time to go ahead and enjoy one of the few hobbies he had. He planned on sleeping at eleven at night, so at eight he went off to play piano.

As he'd been playing with Antares earlier, things definitely seemed different. There was a feeling of worry drenched in the room, but now it felt more like the calm after the storm, when although it may have caused some destruction, everything was better now. At least, as "better" as it could be.

He didn't feel like playing anything in particular. He grabbed a blank book of sheet music, and began experimenting, trying to find a nice melody. Once he did, he began playing it, fixing anything junky or off. The final result was worth it.

He played the song over and over again, relaxed.

Then he heard footsteps.

This made him slip up a little.

"Hmm, they were doing so well," someone commented.

"I'm sorry, who are you?" Solaris asked the unknown audience.

"Oh!" A girl quickly went towards the door. "Sorry. I'm Encelad Rossi. Same grade as you. Professor Juno asked me to drop off something at his office, but I got kind of lost," She held up a pair of jars, one filled with an orange, soda-like bubbling liquid, and the other with blue beetles that ran around within, some of them eating each other. 

"It's alright. If you require my assistance, I can absolutely drop what I'm doing and help," Solaris said, as he closed his book.

"No, it's fine. I really liked the song, do you mind if I come back to hear it again?" Encelad asked.

"Of course not. I'm just not quite used to playing in front of someone," Solaris answered.

"Really? But you sound so good!" She laughed.

"I've just had a lot of practice, really. You are absolutely allowed to stop by. I do hope the teachers agree with my decision..." He smiled.

"Okay, then! I'll see you in a few," She said, and left to find Juno's office.

Solaris didn't think much of the small interaction. He didn't know how long the girl would take to find the office, and he somewhat wished he'd insisted he help her out, but before long, Encelad had returned. 

"I genuinely have no idea why I had to leave those jars, but... oh, well. It's not ''really'' my issue anyway. So, what are you playing?" She asked, as she walked into the room. 

"Welcome back. I haven't given it a name, but it's just a quick song of my own design," Solaris passed her the book. 

"I see. Judging from this, there's some pieces you could give a little more on. What kind of emotion were you going for?" Encelad smiled. 

"I actually don't believe I was going for anything. It's a tranquil moment within a time of worry, so perhaps that," He said. 

"I see..." Encelad nodded. 

The conversation went on for a while. Solaris, when acting nice, somehow had managed to click with Encelad. He recognized this. They played songs and ended up writing two extra songs to go along with Solaris' melody, and although they did not name them, Solaris knew they were good. 

He still didn't feel too good, though. He still felt helpless. Because feeling better about oneself isn't always instantaneous. Sometimes, it needs to build up over a while, and the best thing Solaris could do was act as if he didn't feel these emotions. Faking it until he made it. That was the best course of action, in his mind. 

Despite all this, he made a friend. He tied up some ends. He felt good about that part. Perhaps good and bad feelings were meant to blend together in a tango, and balance into a person's self. But he wouldn't linger on such a philosophical thought at the moment, because he wanted to enjoy this moment while he could. It was a good time to enjoy a moment. He didn't usually get to. He was still a teenager, anyway. He couldn't do as much as he might have often felt like he should, but he could do this.  

== Phenomenon ==
Zenith had experienced many strange events in his life. Some were just things that made him a bit confused. Others were things that would probably scar him for life. He remembered being a kid and watching gore tapes with his cousin. It wasn't like he knew what he was seeing, but this definitely built up his immunity to such things. Even if it could get a bit shocking at times.

Seeing them in real life was different. But it definitely helped to see them, knowing how morbid his powers were. 

He never asked for his powers to be like this. His family had always been magical, and it was simply coincidence that his powers would be of death, decay, and darkness. His parents could handle raising a child like him. It wasn't the first time nor the last his family line had and would see dark magic, as one of his cousins (whose name he forgot) withheld similar magic to his, except he could manipulate it from its original intent of harm to heal.

Zenith's weren't like that. They could be used for good, sure, but they'd always be dark. 

He also remembered the first time he'd seen something die not online, but in real life. It was a cat, which he'd fed only moments before. It ran in front of a car, and he exclaimed at the cat, but a crunching sound was heard, and although it should've darted away, Zenith didn't know he should've called for help at that moment. A few moments later, and the cat was in such suffering, that his father came out with a gun. A bang later, and it was quiet. Zenith spent a long time watching its lifeless body. 

There were many other incidents he remembered. Some he wished he didn't. There were two nights in particular he wished he could purge from his memory... He would not dare to let his mind wander to them, but sometimes, it was inevitable and his brain forced itself to, his attempts against it making on effect. He used to have nightmares over them. For a moment, he shut down, and that moment wasn't very good. Not right now. 

Zenith's fingers were heavily coated with chalk. It was late Sunday, and he'd been teaching Cressida a bit more Russian and some more Math. He was surprised when she told him she was learning on her own too, now. Cressida didn't know as many things as her classmates, but she was learning at a faster rate than what most people went through. Of course, the language would need more time, but still... Their room now had a chalkboard and a desk next to Cressida's bed, which was helpful, because now Zenith had somewhere to hold himself so he wouldn't fall over.

Cressida was a little confused when she saw how Zenith just froze up. "Hey dude, are you okay?" She asked, setting aside her notebook.

"Sorry. Uh... Let's jus' keep workin'," He shook his head, and kept trying to teach Cressida. Now that the memories had started rushing back in, though, it was hard to make them stop, like a broken dam. She nodded, and followed his hand with his eyes.

The chalk broke. Zenith stiffened.

"Uh, I think that's 'nough for today," He stated.

"Alright, then," Cressida grinned. "I'm gonna go with my friends, we have a little event," She said quickly, and left the room. 

"Fair e-" Zenith didn't get to finish his sentence because of how fast she rushed out. "M'kay..."  

He went into his own room. It was almost identical to his old room, but a bit more classy and definitely less messy. It definitely had the environment of a small apartment, but it was still neater than the apartment. He had his cupboards and stove and many tools he'd use at Kinyun Kafe. Pills for the nerves. The sheets were always done, unlike at home. His drum kit was near his bed, which in turn was near the cupboards. His drawers had the clothes he'd brought here, but it wasn't like he was planning on using them any time soon.  

Self-cleaning and body cleaning uniforms was quite the innovation for people who didn't always have the motivation to shower. He lied down, concentrating on breathing, but it wasn't easy, so he made a drink that had about the same equivalent of sugar as a package of Oreos, and drank it, not in the mood for anything bitter, and instead more of a mood of going into a coma for several weeks. 

If Zenith went into a coma, though, he'd probably end up remembering more memories than he wanted to. He didn't want to. He washed his now-empty mug slowly. His brain screamed at him not to, he didn't just feel like something bad would happen, he knew it, and the memories were fluttering in... The only thing he clearly knew was that needed to get out of this room.  

So he decided to follow Cressida and see what she was doing. 
----Zenith still couldn't get a grip over this school. He'd grown up with magic throughout his life- like many children before him, as around a third of the global population had some sort of magical ability- and he knew it as much as many of those children. However, having dark powers meant things kids with water powers, or wind, or music, or colors, or really any but his, meant strange things were bound to happen.

There were people like him. People with powers related to the occult or supernatural, death or plague. But few had powers that encapsulated most fields within them. Powers like fire, light or darkness often had many sub-powers. Zenith wasn't sure if Cressida knew what she was capable of. She was just getting her footing in this world, after all. 

Zenith didn't know the full capacity of his abilities, either. Sure, he'd experimented once or twice, but powers like his were often used for malevolent acts. He never had the urge to do that. 

So when he traversed the castle walls, he should have expected something strange to happen to him. He saw ghosts daily and occasionally met much nastier spirits, but he didn't expect to see into the heavens once again.

He did it once before, in class. Everyone else saw his eyes blacken, because his vision darkened as well. But then he saw light, and it was as if he was really in another existence. Zenith could peek into the final fate of a person.

But this was different. This was new. 

He did not see into the life of someone in heaven, nor did he peer into hell. Instead, he was in a place right down the middle, where there was heavenly light piercing upwards and the threat of flames looming below. A building with drawings of people, societies, and incomprehensible messages and art. Any normal person would not understand this, but Zenith was not normal.

This was Purgatory. Zenith had an understanding that it went on for miles, with drawings of people, and billions of rooms set just for judging individual people. Gentle rumbles on the floor every few seconds indicated another person had a room made for them. Of course, Zenith was right in the heart of the place, and although he'd never been, he had some belief of a force out there giving him the knowledge he needed- Even if that force wasn't the kindest.

Zenith hadn't much of a doubt due to what he had seen, but he did wonder who or what it or they were. Music from an unseen organ was playing throughout the main room. It was peaceful. It would be peaceful if he wasn't seeing a man he'd met not-so-long ago. When he was around thirteen, to be specific. 

Stéphane. Stéphane Mercier, Antares and Mercury's dad. A redhead with each eye like one of his sons', strong and chained to the ground, in a kneeling position, with long nails and sharp teeth. 

Their meeting was wordless. Stéphane gave Zenith a look of contempt. Zenith felt as if his mind was on fire and telling him to get out of his vision right now. Zenith knew Stéphane had some sort of powers, but not what they were exactly, so he couldn't rule out the possibility that Stéphane was actually seeing him. His heart started beating so fast, his chest felt like it'd explode.

Memories rushed in faster than he'd ever experienced them, one after the other, all while staring into the face of a man that caused so much fear into his life, despite him having once loved his son, and now loving the other one. He knew he did not have the approval, and the only way he ever momentarily got his approval was by-

Zenith flashed back into his phase of reality, hyperventilating, dizzy. He slumped down the side of the castle wall, trying to breathe, choking on his breath, trying again. He sat like that for a while. He was scared inside, but once he caught his breath, he just stared at the opposite wall. Then Kranion, who had been roaming the castle free, slithered into his lap. It took a while to calm himself down, patting the snake. 

But once he did, he remembered his goal, and went straight back to it.
----Zenith was now in the yard. It was a cloudy day, around eight in the afternoon. The air was cool. He didn't know exactly where he had to go, but to be honest, he couldn't care less. It might have been reckless, sure, but it did get his mind off the memories.

Until it didn't. Then he got nervous again. What if Cressida was in danger? What if they were trying to hurt her or kill her? Eliminating the competition... He didn't know her location. He didn't know who she was meeting with. His thoughts went back to the beginning, and he'd let Kranion try to find her using her scent, so he was completely alone.

His left hand went into its correspondent pocket and messed with the teabags inside. The grass was freshly cut. Was there staff cutting the grass? He had to ask himself questions he probably wouldn't find out the answer to in order to get his mind off the issue in hand.

Suddenly, something clicked into his brain. He could do something to find Cressida much faster, if he could find a fresh body. But there weren't any- The games. What happened to the bodies? Were they shipped home, or perhaps still in the school? He couldn't waste so much time trying to find something that might not be at school, although he had a feeling they were being contained somewhere.

Ghosts, on the other hand, had all the time they needed. If Zenith was lucky, he could get them to find both the bodies and Cressida. Cressida was the more pressing matter, but he wanted to know if the school had offered the deceased some respect. A side-plan stemmed from a plan. 
----Zenith knew Kranion was still searching, so if his plan backfired, at least he had a back-up. But he still had to hurry. He rushed in through the rooms looking for anywhere with a particularly dark aura, where he knew spirits ''had'' to reside. He knew about some locations, but in places like these, there were bound to be areas where ghosts gathered around. In his head, he was writing a quick note to make sure to try and create a spell to detect ghosts and people's locations, because this could not happen again.

He couldn't lose Cressida. She relied on him, badly, and he cared for the girl like a sister. He took her in because he knew she needed help, and he knew he appreciated the company. 

He knew he'd have to refine a spell for localizing- he often had to make his own spells- but for now, the best he could do was experiment. He bent his fingers, trying to force something out of them, and his palms faced each other. A thin, shaking, purple line appeared- magic. Now all he had to do was concentrate, warp this magic into a steady beat like an instrument, make it play the song he needed it to and-

He slammed himself into a desk. Just his luck. The string was gone, too. A shred of hope, gone. Why did he not think this further? Why did he have to panic so badly and do such irrational things? He shouldn't have tried anything. Cressida probably wasn't even in danger. He just came to assume she would be. He tried to make the string reappear, but the boost in magic he'd gotten from fear, from a strong emotion, was no longer there. 

He stared blankly at the wall and felt himself drop down to the floor until he was facing the ceiling. He didn't realize he'd even done so until he felt something.

A presence. A person. A dead person. 

He got up and looked around. Ghosts sometimes took a bit to appear, especially recent ghosts. They couldn't really control it, but Zenith could feel their presence if they were close. He couldn't describe it. It was on another level of understanding only people who got to experience it first hand could know.

It helped to push something out of the spirit plane, but he didn't know how to. He knew it was possible. 

It also helped to push something into the plane. That was easy. As long as he found a small creature he could... 

An ant on the floor. He crushed it with his finger, and felt as its soul left its body. Tangible yet not. Perceptible at the very least. He put his hands around it, encompassing it. Then came some words. "K'thrani n'kin ter'corrtsa al in kor n't kiros," He said, pronouncing the words just as he'd written them long ago. It had taken him months to make the spell, after all. He knew what he was doing.

This was now a creature that was of the human realm, yet now dwelled in the spirit realm. Like entering a forbidden area. 

"Whoever's near me, take this bein' as your own kin, an' do as ya see fit," He said. Ancient words for sure, but he modernized them a little and summarized the whole paragraph in the process. It was inviting the ghost into his world as the ant went into their world. An eye for an eye.

Something wrapped its hands around it, and he felt it exit his grasp.

"Okay," they said gently, and purple magic crackled from their arms, from where their veins once were. He knew it was because since the spirit of the ant had been infused with his own magical energy, and the spirit was now passing through the ghost's body. If he could even call it a body.

"You know, Anna, you could try a little harder to make yourself presentable for this person," Another ghost said. Slowly, it formed into a being, a person around Zenith's age with curled hair and lynx ears, and many different tattoos of nature along their body. Their dead eyes must have had colored sclera- "Like Mercury's," Zenith thought-  which Zenith recognized due to them being a slightly darker shade of white than the average ghost's eyes, although barely so.  

"Kay," Anna sighed, and formed as well. 

Zenith smiled, then tried to gain more trust from them. "So, what's it feel like t' be dead?" He asked, though a bit rushed. 

"It feels like you're going over your death repeatedly. It feels like you're just flying. You're nebulous, a paradox. At least you're intangible if you want to be," Wren answered.

"'Right. I need a favor," Zenith said.

"What?" The two asked at the same time.

"One of my friends' been goin' with Cherie- This girl who fought in th' first event- Somewhere..."

"Who?" Anna asked.

"Cressida. Blonde w-"

"That girl who talked to Antares sometimes before we died?" Wren looked at Anna.

Zenith flinched a bit at the mention at the name. He didn't really expect it coming. "Oh. Y'haven't been followin' him anymore after dyin' have ya?" 

"Nah. There's lots to see. But yeah, probably. Stay here, I'll try to find her," Anna flew through the wall (and Zenith).

"Anything else you need from us?" Wren asked.

"Just outta curiosity, where did they put your bodies?" Zenith wondered. He knew they had to be somewhere in the castle, or else why would the ghosts be here? Ghosts didn't roam around the place they died, they roamed near their bodies, or else graveyards would be empty. They could travel the world if it wasn't for the fact that their bodies remained stationary, and leaving them behind too much would hurt the ghosts more than their own deaths.

"That's something me and Anna are trying to figure out. I... can't find the bodies anywhere, and I've been dead for four days. The castle doesn't take that long to inspect from top to bottom, and-" Wren put on an oversized pair of glasses, floated quickly and back from a nearby bookshelf with a book in hand, and flipping through it continued, "In fact, we've investigated towers A through F, gone through every classroom and every corridor, and even been in the rooms of the alphas and their children. The only place we can't understand is Liza's room, since it's completely blank- Must be for creative purposes."

"Tower G is magically locked- We can't enter it, it's locked using a caelumelody, an obscure source of magic which involves playing an instrument in order to create magic, as if the magic was a verse in a song, and can only be done by few people in this world. There's a student here who can use it, and Liza, of course, can. We know there has to be something in there. Then, there's the grand rotunda, which is not only quite far from campus- we had to float all Saturday through the forest just to get there because Anna distracted me and made me forget to bring the book with the full campus map- but locked with a caelumelody as well," Wren continued.

"Full campus map? Didn' they give that t' us at the start of th' year?" Zenith kept that in one of his clothes drawers, but he'd forgotten which one.

"No. They gave us a very small view of the entire thing. This isn't just a high school, it doubles as a college, so it's to be expected it'll have a larger amount of land than normal, and since the land does belong to a group of war heroes, there's areas you wouldn't believe are around here. This place oversees the ocean, so apart from our rocky cliff and large amount of water on our left, we've got a small beach area. We have a volleyball team. Did you see all the pamphlets for clubs? There's kids from all over the country here. It wouldn't be an understatement to say from all over the ''world.'' Anna and I have been kind of playing Nationality Bingo," Wren chuckled at that last bit.

"But the beach is just a fraction of the entire thing. The forest sure obscures a lot, but there's been a lot of tiny things you wouldn't detect, like small decorations, art projects, or activities left behind, remnants of picnics, one time I even found a shoe strung up from a tree. Swings. Deeper in there, there's an abandoned building, meant to be a future middle school but eventually left on hold. There's an abandoned basketball court, which they eventually built into the school. There's a soccer field, but the team won't start up until November."

"Of course, there's the rotunda. There's a building filled with documents, but we aren't going to check them out yet, they labelled it Room Seventeen. There's a small shelter for graduates who can't buy homes yet and don't have jobs. There's even a small shop for supplies at the very end of the forest, but it was abandoned because Liza discovered how to make the school create things. There's a waterfall nearby it, and below there are more acres of land, but we haven't gotten to those yet, and they aren't in the map," Wren said. "But part of that land is the school's property. Not all of it, but some of it. This is the book I'm using-" Wren showed off the cover of the book he was holding- "It has everything in here! There's probably another copy at the library"

"''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Jarvis Taberni's History and Guide to Surviving Zios High'.'' Seems a'ight t' me. I'll keep it in mind," Zenith nodded.

"If you ever have the time to, try and help us get into Tower G and Room Seventeen, okay? Not that we need help for Room Seventeen, but it might be useful to have someone who's still alive in case there's something people need to see, like a conspiracy," Wren requested.

"Sure thing," Zenith accepted.

A few minutes passed, and Zenith felt that familiar sensation of having a ghost pass through his skin. 

"She's in Tower D. The beige one with the weird religious motifs," Anna said.

"Alright, I'll take him so you won't have to go through the whole ordeal again," Wren smiled. 

"Thanks," Zenith sighed, letting his feeling of worry wash away. Yet this was only replaced by a new feeling of terror over what she was doing there, why she was in a religious place considering what she'd gone through. If Anna had seen her in danger, ze probably would have told him, but ze didn't mention any of that, so he could only assume she was in risk.

Wren floated in front of him, and Zenith followed.
----Zenith watched the tower silently for a moment, trying to figure out a plan. Wren floated in front of him, their head inside the wall, peeking. 

"There anything useful?" He asked, putting his hand inside the ghost.

"There's something like a rose window with a crystal image of a blue-grey heron. I can't say I've studied enough about windows to say what kind- But you ought to check it out, maybe it's reflective," Wren said. 

"Aight, but how do I get up there?" Zenith asked.

Wren seemed to think about it for a moment, calculating it in their head, and then mumbled, "...''Magic..."'' 

"Fair 'nough," Zenith laughed, and went to the back of the tower to examine it.

He couldn't scale the wall, and he didn't have a spell to, so he cracked his knuckles and- A plan flashed into his mind. He made a large tombstone underneath him, raising him up until he could see through the tall window, and tried to peek through. 

Everyone inside was distracted, and he was unnoticed by pure luck. It was dark, so his reflection wouldn't be seen. 

Candles lit up the room as an ominous liquid bubbled from a cauldron. The people inside were circling it, chanting in tongues, in unison. He knew that clearly, there was something wrong, so he let his hands use magic, formed a few skulls- Which weren't real- and let them fly against the glass...

''Crush. Shatter.'' One of the people noticed, and turned around, and soon the others did, but Cressida, Aisumi, and two others who Zenith did not recognize (one a bird, although whether or not they were actually one was debatable considering their wings were made out of flames yet clearly corporeal,) and a boy with red, curly hair. The others quickly got in a position to be able to attack.

"Huh, so I was right, Cherie," Zenith stared coldly at the woman in question, "Ya ''are'' puttin' Cressida in danger," He said, standing on the ledge, dodging and crushing pieces of glass left on it as he did so. He figured if he was about to fight someone, if he was about to put himself in the danger for the sake of his friend, then he may as well have a little fun with it and deal with the nerves, too. It wasn't like he could turn back now.

"I'm not. I'm simply allowing her to see things from a different perspective. Perhaps you would benefit from doing so as well," Cherie groaned, stretching, then quickly walked up the stairs. which led to a floor which was close enough Zenith could jump down onto without any issue.

"That's jus' gaslightin', and ya know it. I don't know what you're really doing here, but I don't think somethin' like ''witchcraft'' is a good thing," Zenith figured a cauldron would indicate towards such a thing.

"Witchcraft isn't real. You out of all people should know as much, considering how you do have power over death, the dark, and so on," Cherie smiled gently, "So try and tell me what I did wrong other than teach them of my goddess and let them join in, obviously an accepted goddess considering her- now destroyed- image on the tower."

"It's not really teaching if you're forcing them. It's propaganda," Zenith grumbled.

"Yes, alright, then. Why don't we get you out of here, stubborn oaf?" Cherie rolled her eyes, and let a shotgun appear, which shot at Zenith, but its bullet missed him by a few inches.

"I will, when I know Cressida, and ev'ryone else here's safe," Zenith said.

"I'll guess we'll have to agree to disagree," Cherie said, and pushed Zenith out with a baston. Out the multiple story tall tower.

Zenith, in a split-second decision, let a skull appear below him. The fall was still hard, and he clenched, his teeth, but climbed onto it regardless, feeling some new bruises on his body. The skull flew back to the window, and he tapped it gently, watching the horror in Cherie's eyes. He wanted Cherie to suffer for what she was doing to his friend, but knew it was just a momentary feeling. He hated having to hurt them. He didn't want it to amount to this, but...

The skull moved to his will, and tapped the window. The window shattered.  Cherie let out a scream, and her minions rushed to her aid, except for those who were still near the cauldron. Three of them turned into direwolf beings on their back paws, with long fangs and messy blue fur, which got darker depending on the one he was looking at, and clawed viciously at the skull. The other tried to constrict itself into the skull's eye, and bash it from there. 

Zenith let it lower until they could only hope to grasp him by the ankle, and let it open its jaws. A ball of pure magic started to form, bright. But it wasn't bright magic at all. It'd cause pain to anyone who touched it, like a gigantic punch, and it aimed right towards Cherie, with a hum.

It fired, and Cherie dove away, rolling on the floor. Zenith hummed, noticing how scared she looked now despite her behavior earlier. He materialized multiple small skulls and let them charge up as well, while aiming some at the tower itself. Maybe if he did it right, it'd collapse, but wouldn't harm the people as long as he didn't forget to add skulls above their heads so they would protect them. 

The snake-like one wrapped itself around Zenith's neck after a few seconds, and tried to choke him like a constrictor, so he decided to give it a quick, non-lethal stab with a rib. Of course, it wasn't really a small stab, as they were clearly in enough pain to fall back onto the floor, letting out a groan, and they held the area under their left kidney as they bled profusely, eyes squinting. Zenith threw some bones over them, just so they'd be safe within the chaos.  

Zenith didn't know how to free Cressida from her spell, but there wasn't enough time to think about that as Cherie was already charging up what looked to be like a huge attack, so he had to use the skulls he'd prepared at Cherie, which she didn't see coming. She lost enough concentration for her spell to backlash against her, quickly causing bruises, cuts, and scratches all over her body, collapsing to the floor. Weakly, she pointed at the wolf girls, who lunged at Zenith, dragging him to the floor.   

They started scratching his body with their powerful claws, prompting Zenith to make as many bones as he could to protect himself, buying him some time. Tears started welling up in his eyes as large gashes appeared on his body, the pain was dizzying, and as the wolves tried to reach him, he created some larger charged skulls, such that they would aim at the wolves from above. He grunted as he let it fire, and watched as they all collapsed on top of him. They were ''heavy,'' and threatened to crush him, but knocking them out made them loose grip on their forms, quickly turning back into teenagers, making it easier for him to push them off with the bones on top of him. The ache was insane, he was bleeding, and he covered them in bone so he wouldn't die, too.    

"Damn, at least make this... hard..." He mumbled, trying to play the injuries off. He quickly realized what a bad idea that was, as he found himself surrounded by guns from all sides. He didn't ever think there were that many gun models. "Ah, f***."   

"Should I take that as you surrendering?" Cherie gave him a sour look.   

Zenith got onto one knee.   

"Good job. I knew you would realize you cannot keep going on for-" And he let the skulls facing the tower fire.    

In a split second, Zenith realized five things.   

For one, death truly was horrifying to cause.   

For another, this didn't have to happen.   

Third, he would not be able to pass this off easily as an act of self defense if he erased the evidence.   

Fourth, he had to save himself and the people around the cauldron, so in an even faster movement, he placed huge skulls above them.   

And finally, he wasn't going to be able to save many of those who were there that day.   

The tower crumbled down, so loudly he couldn't hear anything but noise.   

Then, there was silence. And the silence was worse than the noise.    
----Zenith didn't know whether to clean up the scene or not. He'd been planning to- it would be sloppy if he didn't- but now, if he touched the bodies, he would be taken in for questioning not for self-defense, but for murder. 

"Damn, why am I even thinking of this as if I was..." He started thinking out loud, but he held his tongue. Cressida! "S***!" He exclaimed, as he ran over to uncover the bodies, thankfully easily spotted due to the cracked skulls around them.

She had large gashes over her face and skin, some of which he ''knew'' would be permanent, but she was ''breathing.'' Zenith's eyes started to well up with tears. The situation instantly pulled all its weight on him. He didn't know how many cult members were gone, but he also knew that Cressida was alive. He cared deeply for her, and as her eyes fluttered alive, he smiled as if he was witnessing the birth of his own child. 

"Huh... wh..." She mumbled, right eye looking about aimlessly. She had her left eye closed. 

"Okay, uh, uh..." Zenith stuttered as he tried to figure out what to check if she was safe. "Oh! How many fingers am I holdin' up?" Zenith held up two fingers in front of Cressida.

"Two..." Cressida said softly.

"Okay, now how many?" He asked. He held up four fingers in front of Cressida's left eye, and put his right hand just over Cressida's right eye, so she would only be able to distinguish if she opened the other one.

"...I don't..." Cressida murmured.

"...Don't what?"

"Can't tell..." Cressida closed her eye again. 

"Oh s***, Cressy..." Zenith whispered. 

Her left eye was no longer golden hazel. It was a milky white. "You've gone partially blind from the whole... God..." Zenith connected the horrifying dots out loud. Maybe her vision could come back in the future, but for now...

He left her on the ground for a moment, so she could take a rest. Then, he rushed to check up on the other bodies.  

"Aisumi has to be alive, she was right... next to me" Cressida said behind him, voice cracking.  

"Alright, d' ya think ya can help me dig 'er out?" Zenith responded. 

"I guess..." She said. Her hands shook as she picked up pieces of stone...  
----Their hands were coated in dried blood, dirt, and dust. They rode through Ètares instead of walking in public, which got rid of that. Zenith didn't regret sparing Cressida from any judgement, but he did regret having the evidence on his body wiped. He wasn't sure what to do. Cressida was acting relatively calm. He was, too. 

They kind of had to act calm. People here didn't panic over death for some reason or another. Fear of getting in the game next, fear of attention, or in their- especially Zenith's- case, fear of getting arrested and executed. The entire had seen many classmates kill others at this point, so it wasn't that bad for Cressida, seeing as she didn't have to see the bodies or how they all died, but... Zenith did. 

Zenith dug the dead ones.

He could ''sense'' their forces- or lack of such.

And every time he had to touch the recently deceased, he felt a bit drained, he could practically see their last moments (though not literally, most of the time), and he'd never forget the looks on their faces.

Out of the twelve members of the club, six of them had made it out. The flaming bird, one of the crystal girls, a snake-like one, the shady kid who looked like Cherie's right hand mate, and of course, Cressida and Aisumi. The rest of them would only remain in Zenith's memories, their blood tainting his eyes (metaphorically). 

One of the kids didn't even have a head.

He hated himself for being so careless.

"We might need a cover story," Zenith said, as they walked. 

"We should just tell them what happened," Cressida thought out loud.

"What d' ya think they'd say t' ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'so 'pparently there was a cult here and we killed half the members'?"'' Zenith asked sarcastically.

"Yeah, I see what you mean. But lying's never the answer. My parents did it all the time, and that's basically living proof that lying equals bad," Cressida asserted. 

"...Look, I'll figure it out," Zenith groaned, frustrated. This whole day only went from bad to worse. 

The rest of the day was completely blurred to Zenith. He knew that he had to have immediate medical care. He wasn't entirely sure what he told the nurses. He asked Cressida, over and over again, if everyone was alright, and Cressida had to remind him that no, not everyone is okay, and then he'd let out an exasperated sigh and say "I thought that," but five minutes later the interaction would repeat again, because it brought him some comfort, it brought him some understanding, it brought his confused, clouded mind to a temporary light before flooding back into nothing, and he didn't comprehend anything. 

Cressida somehow understood everything. The roles were reversed, Zenith was normally the one who overthought everything, whose mind was running faster than a freight train, but now her mind was going on the same track, and she'd ask the nurses a lot of questions, and wrote the answers down on a napkin. Zenith's freight train of a mind had crashed.  

Of course, eventually he'd regain some sense of control.  

But Cressida's mind would never go back to the same sense of innocence again. 

== Pentaptych ==
"Pentaptychs are conformed of five panels, or sections, a centerpiece, and double folding doors, or wings. Think of them as what you could place over an altarpiece," Miss Karrot said, while a presentation behind her showed an image of the aforementioned pentaptych. 

In the hubbub of constant death and personal issues, Antares often forgot that he was at school and not just a death trap. School was basically a death trap itself, though. Mercury normally talked to Polaroid in Reviewal and Art, so Antares was stuck next to Caelum. He only knew him through Cressida, kind of, since they were both kind of friends with each other. Reviewal was usually spent with the occasional "so what do you do for fun?" "try not to die," followed by a giggle, or otherwise meaningless dialogue accompanied by meaningless quips. Speaking of Reviewal, Ms. Karrot was talking to them about pentaptychs for a project. Apparently, they were supposed to make one in assigned pairs for their exam score. 

Caelum seemed distant. More than usual. They usually did their own thing, but he just didn't seem responsive. At all. The first phase was conceptualizing, and the clock ticked by, he realized they hadn't gotten anywhere, while everyone else already gotten out sketches, and was seriously considering telling Ms. Karrot some lie about how they just weren't in a good mindspace or something like that... It wouldn't be the first time Antares lied to get out of working, but he was actually kind of looking forward to this one, since he'd been thinking about implementing fire. 

Regardless, he'd need to have a talk with his classmate.  

He had more things to deal with, too. 
----During recess, he noticed Solaris usually patrolled the school, unless this one locket he owned beeped, which meant someone was in trouble or there'd be an incident. Mercury knew about it, but Solaris told Antares further in detail... After a few dozen questions, he found out it worked more like a magical, mechanical smartwatch (smartlocket?) built by Graham, and he could call and text through it. 

He also noticed that there wasn't much security around the dorms. It was... obvious, and yet things seemed to rely a lot on student morality, and teachers occasionlly patrolled, sure, and Solaris was around, but students could sneak into others' dorms easily.  

So instead of going to Solaris' room today, or his own dorm room, he went to Apollo's room. Antares... needed to deal with the feelings left over. He'd gotten a bit better at expressing himself. He'd noticed that speaking with Solaris kept him on edge, and uncomfortable, but Solaris could coax emotions out of him so easily, like a mist laid over his eyes, and he wanted it, but at the same time he felt a need to push away, and Solaris hadn't wronged him, so the problem was him, and now the depressing thoughts were back, so he opened Apollo's door. 

He was becoming more strategic. Thinking things out a little more. Sure, he used to make schedules, but now, he had schedules for those schedules... More of Solaris' subconscious doing, he supposed. 

Where Apollo's artstyle was mostly abstract, focusing more on color, shapes, and feelings, Antares focused mostly on realism. Except he wasn't that great at it, so his style inevitably lead towards a mix of both, where if he were to draw a bull, the head would be lines and pieces and one of the hooves would have all the detail he could. He just couldn't sit still enough to complete a masterpiece, but the people who cared usually thought it was quite creative. He considered it a bit of an issue... He could never focus on the full image.  

This time, he wanted to paint an ocean. That was how he felt like- Like a tumultuous ocean neath a thunderstorm. He wanted to have a pirate's ship and a man looking at the waters in the crow's nest with a brave face on.  

He soon realized painting murals was way harder than doing drawings on his notebook. He'd just finished about a quarter of the base sketch for the whole piece, and he realized the bell was already ringing in the distance. It was time for English. So he gave up on it, believing he'd never complete it anyway, and ran.   
----"Slightly late, Mr. Mercier. You've kept us waiting," Ms. Muriel said.

Antares mumbled an apology- Normally he'd get furious at himself and the teacher for calling him out, but at ''least'' he only heard a handful of giggles instead of having the whole class burst out laughing. It was a possibility!

His brother, once again, was sitting next to Polaroid, so he slid next to Solaris and let out a little sigh as the other students resumed their usual murmuring- Ms. Muriel didn't let them speak, but she couldn't hear that well if the volume was low enough.

"How likely do you think I'd get caught if I brought some chips in here?" Antares asked Solaris, accompanying his question with a swift poke to Solaris' left arm.

"Very. I'd make a minor exception for you, though," Solaris smiled gently.

"Yeah? What kind of exception?" 

"You must stay in the basement for two weeks and have to help me snuff the lights out at night," Solaris joked. 

They were on decent terms... Antares didn't like the way he was serious about ninety-nine percent of the time, but at least he got to tap on his nicer side after last night. And here, he thought he'd have to deal with some sort of mortal enemy... Something just seemed to make them click.

"Mmm, not bad, Abramowicz. Okay, what can you get away with in this school? Not, like, us in general, ''you,''" Antares asked another joke question.

"Hmm. Skipping class, if I planned it ahead," Solaris considered the question completely seriously, thinking up about twenty ideas to get out of the classroom in just a second.

"Bet," Antares grinned.

"Wh- ''oh.'' What do you want to do?" Solaris asked. They could make up this class, they were just learning about Animal Farm, which Solaris could easily teach and discuss with Antares, who didn't seem too interested in the first place. Solaris had actually read the book, after all- Most people in the room had looked up a summary instead. He'd found out through the babble, picking out lines such as "I ran it through AI, I didn't get it," and "So does Old Major die or something?"

"I dunno. If I wasn't in the expensive private high school to college for magical teenagers, I'd probably go throw rocks with my friends. What do kids here usually do?" To be fair, he didn't really have friends, he just had dudes he occasionally hung out with until they committed a minor misdemeanor and had to flee the scene. 

Solaris noticed Antares was opening up a little to him, which was quite the overnight advancement from not wanting anything to do with him. He thought about what they could do for a moment, and answered, "How about we practice fighting?" 

"Good idea. It's a Monday, so..." Antares sighed, thinking about all the deaths that were bound to come up. The class's numbers had slowly lessened. 

"The times are... tough. I do hope we don't get paired up together... We'd know our weaknesses, and we'd die from exhaustion..." Solaris watched Miss Amelia keep reviewing their essays from The Great Gatsby.

"On other notes, Group A is making a group chant... My father wants us to make one too, but... I'd much rather save myself the embarrassment." Solaris thought out loud.

"Wait, there's other ''groups?!'' Also, aren't we gonna skip?"

"Oh, sure, you've convinced me, but how did you ''not'' notice there's other groups? I mean, we don't even all share the same classes all the time," Solaris was a bit shocked.

"...I'm... Wow. Okay! There's a lot of people here! How many groups are there?" 

"Four per year. We share most of the same classes, but occasionally we switch it up to promote interaction within students. Your friend Anna, for example, used to be in Group D. If someone in our class dies, I'll try to hold a funeral for them," Solaris' thoughts were morbid at the moment, and it was reasonable given the circumstances. All conversations in this school eventually circled back to death within the first years. Even older students were trying to help, to no avail.

"Wow. I met Anna after PhysMa... You should, mmm..." ''"Teach me how to be more aware of my surroundings,"'' he wanted to say, but he knew he was just looking for an excuse to... Well, he didn't want to accept it. 

"Yes, Antares, I'd love to spend some time with you," Solaris said, understanding Antares' intent perfectly. 

Sadly, so did the rest of the class, who'd gone quiet when Solaris said that. 

Then, they exploded in excited cheers and screams, believing the pair to be on a date. 

"Settle down, or I ''will'' give you all detention!" Solaris exclaimed, which quickly shut them up. 

"Thank you, Mr. Abramowicz," Amelia glanced up to smile at Solaris, and then went back to reviewing.

Solaris rubbed the back of his neck, and said, "It's not a date."

"No, they're just teasing us," Antares clarified.

"Where you lack academically, I lack in social skills... I wouldn't even know what to do on a date. For years, Polaroid was my only friend..." 

"Am I your friend?"

Solaris' ears twitched, and he took in deeper breaths. "Well, uhm, I mean, if you want to be."

"I would very much like that, Mr. Abramowicz," Antares smiled, giving his most gentle smile he'd ever given the bear. "Or should I say, Solaris?"

His voice was quite sweet, yet retained its natural rasp when he said Solaris' name, and Solaris' ears twitched further, a small blush forming onto his face. He wouldn't have admitted it at the time, but he found Antares somewhat charming...

"Heh," Antares chuckled, knowing exactly what he'd done.

"Oh, well, would you- Would you look at the time? It's time for math! Let's get... going!" Solaris said, embarrassed.

"No skipping?"

"I suppose not..."
----After Math, Cressida slid into her bed, tired. 

Zenith had told the hospital some strange lie that she hadn't fully heard, but whatever it was, was a lie nonetheless. She lamented the losses of the people in the building, but in this school, you had to move on from those as fast as possible. She didn't want more death in her life. 

"I could leave the games..." She whispered to herself, "But I want to prove to my parents that I'm worthy of... living..."  

She still couldn't process the fact that her own parents wanted her dead. 

She couldn't process many things. Academically, she was doing extremely well for someone with her previous knowledge, and the teachers went very easy on her, but emotionally, she was struggling a bit. 

And she bottled it up so she could make sure Zenith felt better, because he was struggling too, and so was everyone else, and maybe, just maybe, if they saw her smiling, they could smile again too, just for a moment. 

She dreaded the thought of PhysMa. Everyone was ''implied'' to need to be there. She did not want to be there.  

As she lost herself in her thoughts, she didn't notice Zenith had walked into the room, carrying a few books. 

"Cressy, you alright?" Zenith asked, patting her hair gently. He left the books on the side of the bed, and had sat down next to her. 

"Mmm... No, I don't think so. I don't wanna kill anyone. And I don't feel okay with you right now. But, uhm, I'll get used to it. And, uhm, I'm gonna go look for... someone." 

"Okay." 

Cressida sat up, and looked at the books. "''The Canterbury Tales'', Marco Polo's ''Travels, The Mabinogion, Beowulf...'' Did you get these from the library? Can I read them?" 

"Actually, they're for you. I couldn't make sense of all the books, got a bit overwhelmed, so I just ordered them in. The butterfly system- ZAHBS- has been malfunctioning for some reason. Butterflies keep turning up dead. People don't receive letters. I'm probably gonna ask Solaris about it. After all, he is kind of like a little teacher." Zenith let out a small chuckle, but his face was clearly that of concern. Perhaps he'd ordered the books much sooner... 

"I guess you're coming with me, then." She mumbled. 

"So. Do we have anything else t' talk about?" 

"...I can't really think clearly right now. Just a few weeks ago, I was just praying, singing, and trying to avoid punishment. Now..." 

"I see what ya mean..." Murder was a nasty word that was nastier in act. 
----Mercury didn't just walk, he zoomed. He knew that his brother was not sleeping in their dorm, and often, not even staying there. It would have been cruel of him not to notice. Frustrated, he grit his teeth, but yelped when he accidentally bit his tongue. 

He was deeply concerned for him, he knew he was probably doing fine, but he just knew he ought to try to talk to him, and somehow, he'd reached Polaroid's room.

He knocked quickly, gently.

"Polaroid, are you there?" He asked, nervously.

Polaroid unlocked and opened the door, confused. "M-Mercury, what's go-going on?" He asked, but Mercury only rushed inside and gave him a hug, squeezing him. 

"O-oh... Well, come here..." Polaroid said.

Over the course of the last few weeks, they had gotten quite close to each other. "Do you know where Antares is?" Mercury twiddled with his hair nervously. Polaroid always got him a little nervous. Could be because they'd kissed before.

"Okay... What's wrong?" The wolf asked, holding Mercury's hands as to try and calm him down.

"I'm just really worried, and he's never around anymore, and I feel like I need to know what's going on or else he might..." Mercury held himself back from saying something he'd regret later.

"...Okay, well, ma-maybe he's staying with Solaris?"

"Why with Solaris?"

"He- he has been for so-some time, you know..." Polaroid's tail bumped against Mercury's, making him blush a little.

"Oh, I'll need to check on him before then... I don't want him getting in trouble..." Mercury watched Polaroid as he ran his fingers on his nails, and his heart raced a little... He quickly planted a kiss on the other boy's right ear, swift and soft and gentle, and got up. The other boy was stunned, and didn't say anything, only pressing his hand to the aforementioned ear. 

"Well, uhm, I'll be back soon!" Mercury exclaimed, and left the room, leaving a shocked, blushing Polaroid behind.

He could hear a dreamy little sigh through the door as he closed it, and his heart was racing. ''"Oh god, I actually did that,"'' he thought. 

Relationships in Zios High progressed fast.

He heard the door lock behind him, and walked to Solaris' room. It wasn't too far, but he'd never been, and the only reason he knew where he slept was because he'd asked Polaroid a long time ago out of his own curiosity. Polaroid...

Polaroid was wonderful, handsome, adorable... He wanted him to be his boyfriend, but then there was someone else that charmed him...

He knocked on the door to Solaris' dorm. "Excuse me, is Solaris here? Is this your room?" He asked, somewhat feigning innocence, knowing exactly where he was going.

The door quickly swung open, revealing four people inside. Solaris himself, at the door, and on the sofas nearby, he could see his brother, Zenith, and Cressida.

"Antares is here." He quickly said, and practically pushed Solaris out of the way (who didn't seem to mind the slight rudeness of the act), and walk right up to the other one. 

"Like, what ''are'' you doing? You do realize this ''isn't'' your dorm, do you? Why did you stay here last night?" He said, with some anger in his voice. Antares was on a sectionary sofa- Mercury hadn't cared much about looking around, he had a goal in mind- on the right seat of the right wing of it. Zenith was directly across of him, Cressida sitting next to him like a little winged ball. 

"Take a seat, Mercury. I'm sure we all have a great deal of information, and issues we ought to resolve. The best thing we can do right now is talk." Solaris said, as he locked the door. It was less of an invitation and more of an order, and he walked to the sofa, electing the middle part of the middle seat. 

"You're right. Let's talk." Mercury let out a small "''Hmph",'' as he crossed his arms and took a seat. 

Antares and Zenith were giving each other the death stare, but they stopped as soon as Mercury sat down, Zenith giving him an awkward smile and wave, while Antares mouthed him an ''"I'm sorry".''

''"It's fine... ish."'' He mouthed back, as Zenith started to work some magic. He formed a string from the palms of his hands, facing each other, but it trembled and danced with the danger of snapping in two. Cressida decided to try and put her own hands, unsure of the purpose of the string, but attempting to help, so their hands formed a square. Her face turned to that of frustration as she forced a string out as well, this one bright like the sun, and they interlocked. 

Zenith grabbed the string of magic, rolled it into a small ball, and stretched it out, actively adding more of his own power into it. The amount of effort this seemed to take was insane, his eyes turning pitch black, his hair moving from invisible wind as he shivered from an unknown cold, and yet he was sweating as if he was in a heatwave, and the ball expanded, and expanded, and was cold but hot at the same time, like a piece of ice when it stops snowing and the sun peeks through, but passed through everyone, and soon, covered almost the entirety of the room as if it was a clear fabric or sheet, with only the slightest tinge of purple with yellow swirls. 

And then, Zenith collapsed onto the sofa, breathing heavily, eyes slowly fading back from black to white and purple, wind gone, sticky from the sweat. "Oh god, I'd... never cast a spell that big, I..." He shivered, his body still not used to the warmer temperature of the place that was neither freezing nor scorching, "I never did a spell w' two people, it's... stronger..." 

"What was that all about?" Antares asked. He'd quickly sprung to his feet, and was already checking out how the spell worked. It wasn't a shield, because he could poke his fingers through the corner of the room he was testing, near Solaris' bed.

"Cloakin' and silencin'. Even if Liza managed t'-" He let out a sneeze, it sounded like a kitten, Cressida broke out in a little giggle, Zenith continued; "Find a way t' hear us in here, because a ''certain'' genius never thought she'd do that..."

"Guilty as charged. I never thought someone could invade such boundary. I ought to have expected it, though. It was a huge oversight from my part, and I apologize." Solaris explained.

"It's okay, you don't have to be perfect, having someone super smart like you really helps," Cressida tried to comfort him, even though Solaris didn't really ''need'' comforting.

"Well, anyway, I had to do somethin'. This spell is completely new, an' Cressida gave me the idea from one of her books, but I had to change up some o' the elements cuz' I knew it'd take way more power than I can muster... an' also, I had to make things easier since I had to cloak the whole room an' for a long time, too." Zenith's eyes were nearly back to normal, but he was still breathing heavily, and if one put their ear to his chest, they'd be able to tell that his heart was pouding heavily.

Antares walked back to his part of the sofa, as Mercury looked at Solaris, and asked; "How about we start off by talking about the magic here?" The bear nodded, and he gave a quick glance to Zenith, so he could voice his problem, which he'd explained earlier, but not with Mercury around.

So in lke 2018 I wrote a god awful fan fiction called Mannequins

it was the first one I ever wrote and it was horrible 😭

SO I decided to rewrite it years later to show my writing improvement 

So without further ado here is mannequins rewritten (it is literally a completely different story with the same premise lmao) 


Hi, if you are reading this, please read the whole thing. My name is Shelly, and this is a warning from me to you. DO NOT buy the new animal jam mannequins. If you won't just heed my warning and move on, please read my story. Then maybe you'll listen. I don't have much time, I can feel my consciousness slowly fading, so please, listen....

A few days ago, animal jam had an update. This update included a new feature: mannequins. They are den items that appear to be blank, statue-like, version of different animal jam animals. If you click on them, you can customize them as if they were your own playable animal. When I saw this update, I thought nothing of it. I was very excited, in fact. I rushed to the diamond shop and blew all my diamonds on multiples of every variant of the mannequins. I quickly clicked on my den to place them and start customizing them. After I did so, I had an idea! I should role-play with them! See, I was desperate for role-play. As my buddies got older, along with most of the active animal jam players, nobody wanted to role-play anymore! It seemed I was the only one left who had any interest in doing so, and these mannequins seemed to me like the perfect role-play partner. I decided to role-play that me and my wolf mannequins were secretly living in a volcano, so I thought the volcano den would be perfect! I switched my den to the volcano den and placed down 5 wolf mannequins, all customized with fox hats, head feathers, bow and arrows, and worn blankets. Stereotypical  role-player outfits. After a while of roleplaying, I got bored and decided to change it up. 

"Oh no! Flame-Paw fell into the lava! Leaf-heart, HELP!" 

I moved one of the wolf mannequins, "Flame-Paw," who wore a red fox hat, and red bow and arrows, with brown fur and fire patterns, into the lava. After a while of pretending to try to rescue Flame-Paw, I noticed that his expression looked almost... pained? But that couldn't be. It was my imagination surely. I looked closer and realized that the mannequin was... blinking? Strange. I was startled out of my focus by the sound of a jam-a-gram notification. I had received a new jam-a-gram from my buddy, Puppiesarecute3453. It read "Hey! did you see the update? Come to my den to check out my mannequins!"

I decided to take a break from my role-play to check out my buddy's den. When I arrived in her den, her and at least 50 mannequins were there to greet me. 

"Hi, Pup!" I said excitedly. "Hi, Shel!" She replied. "Cool mannequins!" I said. "Yeah!! I spent over 400 diamonds on these!!" She replied. After discussing diamonds and mannequins for a little while, I decided to get back to my role-play. 

"Hey, I'm gonna get back to my den to role-play with my new mannequins." I told her. "OOH! Can I join you?" She asked. I agreed. 

When we returned to my den, I immediately noticed something was off with Fire-Paw. His expression was still the same, however, his eyes looked extremely pained. Not even subtly, even a small child could see that something was off. Puppy seemed to notice this too. 

"Whoa! I didn't know mannequins could do that!" She said. 

"Um... I didn't either..." I replied, very confused. 

Ignoring this out of fear, I suggested we resume the role-play. I filled her in on what was going on, and she seemed to understand. We both agreed to kill off Fire-Paw. 

"Hey! Shel! I got him out of the lava! But.... he's... not breathing.." 

I clicked on the mannequin to change his eyes to the X-eyes, but when I did, his expression changed again. His eyes looked scared. It was almost like he was telling me not to change his eyes. This freaked me out, so I didn't. 

"Pup! You spoke too soon! He's still alive! Just barely, we have to act fast." 

I placed some "healing herbs" in my den, and pretended to heal Fire-Paw. After a while of roleplaying, Pup told me she had to go soon. I decided to buy a new mannequin, a fox to match Pup's animal for after she left. After I bought it, I placed it in my den and began customizing it to match Pup's look. After I exited the editor, Pup had left. Or so I thought..... 

I continued my roleplay like normal, but then I heard the sound of another jam-a-gram. For a split second, I swear it said "I'm scared," but then it changed to being a normal jam-a-gram from my other buddy. 

"Come to my den to role-play with mannequins!" 

It seemed I wasn't the only one with this idea. I decided to join my buddy, Sharkyshark56472, to role-play. I arrived in his den and we began role-playing. Soon after we started, I got a text from my mom saying dinner would be ready soon. I told my buddy this, and to buy a mannequin that resembled my animal that could replace me when I had to go. He did exactly that. When he began editing the mannequin, I started to feel strange. I brushed it off, but as soon as he exited out of the editor, everything went black. When I came to, I felt strangely stiff. I opened my eyes, and what I saw shocked me, and confused me. I saw peck's den, the den we had been roleplaying in, and all the mannequins involved in the role-play, only, it wasn't on a computer screen. I was seeing all of this through my own eyes, as if I had been sucked into animal jam. At first I thought I was dreaming, but the longer this "dream" went on, the more I realized this was, in fact, real. I was in shock. I couldn't comprehend what was happening. As I was trying to make sense of the situation, I was pulled out of my focus by a strong tugging sensation. My whole body was moving without me moving it. Then, my body turned, and I stopped moving. I could see a speech bubble above Shark's head. 

"(Keels Shelly)" 

Suddenly, Shark rushed over to me and started jumping. It hurt. It hurt so bad and I couldn't even scream. I couldn't cry, I couldn't run, I couldn't move at all. All I could do was stand there until it was all over. To my relief, he stopped jumping seconds later. Suddenly, everything went black again. When I opened my eyes, I realized I was in the editor. Shark was putting "blood splatters" on me. I braced myself, but all I felt was a strange shifting sensation in my fur. Then, everything went black again. When I opened my eyes, I was back in the den. I could see the other mannequins being moved around. I was staring at them when I noticed something that make my stomach churn. All of the mannequins were blinking. 

Now I realized why Fire-Paw's expression had changed, and why Pup had vanished when I made a mannequin copy of her. Every mannequin in the game was another player. I felt so guilty I wanted to throw up. Why had I tortured Fire-Paw like that? Why did I even buy mannequins in the first place! Oh god I'm a terrible person..... I wanted to cry, I wanted to scream, I wanted to apologize to every mannequin I owned, but it was too late. Suddenly, I was snapped out of my spiral by the recycling screen popping up in front of Shark. By the time I realized what was going on, I didn't even have a chance to brace myself. I was being recycled. I felt a horrible sharp pain all over my body. I just wanted this all to end. I wished I had just gone to eat dinner when I had the chance. It hurt so bad I wanted to rip out all my nerves. Suddenly, it all stopped, and I blacked out again. When I opened my eyes, I was looking at the diamond shop. I saw a wolf walk in. She clicked on me, which felt very strange, and she bought me. Suddenly, I was in her den. Then, before I could even have a thought, I was being edited, and that's where I am now- Oh god...  I'm fading fast... I have to hurry... Wait- is she... oh god... she's changing me to look like her! I can't warn her, I can't do anything except for blink... I think she noticed... I can hear her talking! 

"Oh that's so cool! They blink!"

NO! STOP! PLEASE! PLEASE NO! SHE'S PRESSING THE X... OH GOD-- PLEASE OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD MAKE IT STOP PLEASE I CAN FEEL MY SKIN PEELING OFF AS I WRITE THIS... PLEASE HEED MY WARNING... I BEG OF YOU... I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT BUT IM SCARED. 

Update: Hey! It's Shelly! Sorry about that, its been about 2 days since this happened. After she hit the x, I was freed. If you want to free your mannequins, all you have to do is change them to look like your animal. Just know, if you do this, it comes with a price. 

wait- I just got a jam-a-gram! It's from... Pup? 

"please help" 

Update 2: I decided to free pup, and I am back inside the mannequin. I'm currently trapped in my den, with nobody to recycle me or rescue me. It's been 3 months. The only website I can access is this one because it was open when I was trapped... I can feel myself fading again... so please.. before I'm gone... please do not buy the new mannequins...</text>

''"%#$@#, You shouldn't be acting so reckless!''

''"But what? What is it that you're planning to do? Why?!"''

''"Because you chose a side that defamed me.''

''Those who defame others will eventually be so immersed in the lies, almost to a point where the victim that is genuinely telling the truth will be seen as a liar."''

''"You killed that man, and we have a right to be mad at you, %#$@#. What makes you think you were the victim in all of this?"''

''"Because I was. Yet, you chose not to believe me, even after many times I tried to fess up the truth, you never seemed to take my side."''

''"You killed someone when YOU'RE a government official. You know it makes you seem corrupt."''

''"I'm aware. But, you realize that the clock is ticking, right?"''

''"What could you possibly mean that the clock is ticking?"''

''"Oh, silly Arlo. How innocent you must be..''

''"So.. So we could know the truth."''

''"I've tried telling you the truth, many times, to be exact. You never listened.'' 

''It is a moral to believe the victim at all costs of course, but when I try to reveal the account of what happened to me, it was like a stab to the back by not only my own council, but the people.''

''I tried bringing Runia back to it's glory. I helped and helped, overworked myself until my eyes bled, isolated myself in order to keep everything in balance..'' 

''Only to be destroyed by a mere claim."''

''"It's rather too late to say that now, Isn't it?"''

''"..."''

''"Exactly the response I had expected.''

''You chose who to believe.'' 

''So, if you want to keep spreading this further, I'll have to eliminate you."''

''"E-Eliminate? You're out of your mind, you wouldn't do that to your own council.. R-Right?"''

''"Wrong."''

''".. Please, don't do this! You aren't thinking straight about this! STOP!"''

''"Saya, Saya, Saya. You keep blabbering the same thing over and over again, to think this through and not to actually eliminate you all.''

''Why's that? so I can suffer in the face of the public where I now have a tarnished reputation?"''

''"NO!"''     

----In the kingdom's of Leidenschaftlich, Or Leiden for short, and Myria, both conjoined by a large piece of land, The two of them seemed to have never gotten along with one another, despite their many differences they could easily accept.          

To many, Leiden was everything Myria was not, all due to the way both are presented.           

Leiden was lavish, pomp and very beautiful in architecture: Ivory columns with vines that surround it, furniture made out of silk with many flowers that surround the military waiting room, and a rather pomp throne room, surrounded by roses and guards, only for there to be a king and queen throne, but no queen ever took her place. The library in the second court could be seen as rather sluggish and messy with swarthy colors, but it contained knowledge that the rest of Azuren begged to seek out for.         

Surrounded by such elegance in the courtyards and the fine entrance, near the library is just a quiet area where individuals could sit and take a breather after a stressful day. Outside, a meadow is present, wide and full of trees and greenery with some areas set up by settlers due to the high living expenses. The meadows are seen as rather plain due to it being relatively untouched, but the marvelous kingdom's architecture, outside and inside of the walls, seems to captivate the tourists and those in other kingdoms.       

But, behind such lavishness opens a tarnished reputation in between the holes of lavishness, extravagance and elegance. Leiden is only ruled by a king who does not seem to care for the people around him, causing a relatively high poor population where they would have to tithe what they had left in order to supply the kingdom. Prices of food, specifically staples like rice and bread, began to skyrocket. Once being around ten runes per pound, it is now fifty per pound. King Helios, the supposed mighty king of Leiden, seemed to not do anything about the rapid inflation of goods, letting his population starve and allowed their skin to fall off their bones.           

The treatment of other species, specifically demons by the king, was not too stellar, since he was not the most accepting person an average folk would want to be around. He had ordered many soldiers to kill demons, including rarer kinds that were already on the verge of extinction and not only being endangered, all for the sake of keeping the kingdom "safe," when in sheer actuality, he is only putting a population closer and closer to extinction. The treatment of the people were a large concern, and many other officials checked to see these claims, but everything seemed to be wiped. It looked like all the people were happy, living their lives as normal humans and every need was being met for everyone.. But, when they set foot outside of the kingdom, everything goes back to inequality.             

Myria, however, was not as grand as Leiden, but less problematic by all means. Myria was like a forest, a large and lush one, abundant in many resources with small tents and homes reside in. There was no official castle, but only two, large stone thrones with a sapphire in the middle of both of them sit there with two, off-teal steppes that sit next to them. Despite their rather poor kingdom, the people were happy: They were free. They did not have to fight or protest to get rights, but they already had their freedom.             

Of course, they had their positives and used to get along fairly well with their fair share of disagreements here and there..       

But it never lasted for over a few years, since Leiden had begun stealing Myria's supplies from their abundant kingdom.       
----


It was a lovely summer afternoon, a nice day where the breeze was never too hot or ever too cold, but was just right as most said so. Nothing was burning the soil and drying up the crops, nor was anything covered in ice and withering the wheat, but it was similar to that of a nice spring morning that only happens once in a while. The breeze was a warm wind, blowing smoothly on the crops and trees alike. For the first time in over many years, the summers were not like the heatwaves that had occurred back then.    

The sky was clear and blue, the clouds were swirling in the sky and moving a  a slow pace, the sun beaming down brightly. Below was what seemed to be a rather sacred village, or that was what some people might have assumed. It was actually a hideout, one that was hidden in the lush forests of Azuren. The continent was rather large inside, incredibly large to be more precise, but very little of it was cities, or even kingdoms: It was only mountains and mountains of land surrounded by thick trees and swampy lakes.   

In the sky above is a bird soaring, an odd one to be more exact. A gray, bald eagle with a lighter underbelly with swirly, purple markings and bird armor that is sharp on the edges. On board the large bird is two people, Soul Kawasaki and Cereza Almazan, both desperately trying to find a potion to help her younger twin sister, Arcana, break free from Lilith's control after a squabble gone wrong. Of course, Cereza had made a base for the potion, but something was wrong with it: It did not seem like enough to defeat Lilith entirely.   

Lilith is a different person, stuck inside of Arcana. She is similar to that of another soul inhabiting ones body, and even though she was able to keep this side hidden.. Lilith got the upper-hand, and took over her body, making her fight the people she not only loved the most, but also her allies: And both Soul and Cereza were looking for a way to separate Lilith from her. Lilith was a handful, she was always spontaneously getting more and more out of control and Arcana's body could not seem to take control over her own body, but she did not succumb to her control: She kept fighting and fighting for control over her body, but she lost. Lilith lost herself, and took over her.   

The bird, after getting closer to the land, transformed into a tall man with a deep, brown complexion with ghostly white eyes with a faded brown pupil in the middle, his hair long and beige, extending to his lower back in a curly ponytail. His armor was different from what lieutenants usually wear: A gold helmet shaped like a crown with two large feathers that stuck from the side, all being held by two purple gems, the sides having feathers that dangled down, nearly touching his ear. He did not speak one word to those who talked to him, because he simply could not hear nor speak one word out of his mouth. He was mute, similar to that of insects and younger animals.

This story is kind of goofy and not really overly serious, there'll be some humor and stuff (at least, if my sense of humor isn't outdated). That's mostly because I just want to write a book suitable for children-preteen once I get the hang of this writing thing. Story starts off in an awkward spot so feel free to ask questions in the comments :P'''

'''Hate it? Good, leave a comment down below. This wiki is so dead at this point that I'll basically beg for any kind of comment.''' 

'''Serious Note: Quack'''

=== Chapter 1- Summer School: ===
''Ahhh, the land of Jamaa, a place of great adventure and stories.''

''Well, not anymore. Since the eradication of the phantoms, it has been mostly peaceful and quiet. Not a single threat on the horizon, not a war in sight. So now, nobody remembers the history of Jamaa or the battles between the alphas and the phantoms. Everyone just thinks of it as another small town, another landmark in this big world.''

''But little did the residents know that Jamaa still had one more great adventure to be had.''

''And it all starts in a classroom, near the beginning of summer break.''

Juniper drummed her paw on the table and sighed. She hunched over the desk and put her head down, snout hanging off the desk, waiting for class to end. Standing in front of her was the teacher, who was a pink flamingo who had gleefully introduced herself as Miss Flora a couple of classes ago. Her name was quite fitting for her, since flower patterns ran across all her feathers. 

There were only five other students in the room with her. A small pink fennec fox with a blue spiked collar around her neck who sat in the desk next to her, a miffed expression on her face as she listened to the teacher speak. A white pig with black splotches that sat two desks behind Juniper, face half-hidden by a propped-up book on his desk. And a blue penguin and a snow-white polar bear that sat in the back, the polar bear sitting on the ground instead of his desk. Juniper assumed the desk was a size too small for him.

Miss Flora balanced herself on one leg, all while jabbering away about the ‘grand history of Jamaa’ or whatever. 

“...as you might have known, the animals of Jamaa used to be divided, each only worrying about themselves and their own species,” she explained. “They took each of their heartstones from the pedestals in the temple, not trusting enough of the other animals to take care of them…”

Juniper gazed at a lone clock on the wall next to the school bell and some sort of siren. It was lazily bolted there, slightly slanted, and nobody cared in the least to fix it. And she suspected it was broken, because the second hand refused to move. She looked back down and examined her paws, without a better way to pass the time. ''So this is how I spend my summer, huh?'' She asked herself. ''Locked in a classroom and turning into a history buff.'' 

She looked back up at the teacher, who had shifted her discussion from heartstones onto how the alphas came together. Juniper realized she had missed pretty much everything the flamingo had said.

''Actually, scratch the last part.''

Juniper was startled out of her thoughts when Miss Flora suddenly prompted a question for the class. “Would anyone like to name every one of the main alphas?”

Although the coyote didn’t listen to a single thing the teacher was saying, Juniper still knew the answer by heart. Everyone else in the room did too.

“Liza, Cosmo, Graham, Peck, Greely, Sir. Gilbert,” everyone said plainly at the same time, though the names in various different orders. So, all the teacher heard was a jumbled up mix of sounds and names that almost sounded like names, but not quite.

The names of the six alphas were basically drilled into the heads of every resident in Jamaa at an early age. But what did she mean by main? She wondered to herself. She had only heard of six alphas in her lifetime.

Miss Flora tried to decode what all six students said, though decided to presume they all knew what they were. “I’ll assume you all said Cosmo, Greely, Liza, Sir.Gilbert, Peck, and Graham, not in that exact order, right?” she said with a slight frown. “Then you would be correct. Partially. You’re still missing one.”

Mumbles and whispers flew across the room. These were the alphas they had known and recited all their lives, whether they liked it or not. And sure, the side alphas might have been forgettable in last year’s history class, but certainly not the main alphas. Who were they missing?

Miss Flora almost seemed to bask in the students’ confusion, pleased to finally create a thought-provoking question.

“Okay, if our grade drops because of this one stupid question then it shouldn’t be our fault.” the fennec fox hissed to the others. “Besides, these were the alphas we’ve always known. Anyone else and we’re just stepping into history nerd territory,” she accused out of frustration.

“I remember one other alpha,” Juniper said, trying to get the thinking process going. “Their name was Mica. They’re a coyote alpha. But I’ve never heard anyone other than the other coyotes talk about them, so probably not.” She shrugged

“Maybe the teacher could be wrong,” the spotted pig considered. “I mean, it’s happened before.”

Watching the three argue about whose theory was right were the penguin and polar bear duo sitting in the back. The penguin spoke up.

“Tavi. The last one’s Tavi, the dolphin alpha,” he said in a quiet voice.

The fennec fox swiveled her head around and stared at the penguin, unfazed by his knowledge. “Well of course you would know, Mellow,” she sighed. “You probably studied all this ahead of time. Meanwhile, none of the history teachers I’ve had ever teaches us about this!”

“Well that changes now,” Miss Flora responded, jumping back into the conversation. “And yes, Mellow is right.” She pointed over to the penguin, who otherwise didn’t respond and was scribbling drawings of alphas on a piece of paper. “The seventh main alpha is Tavi. Now, I don’t blame you, since she’s kind of isolated herself. The only main alpha who lives in the ocean, so no one really knows her unless they’ve had an aquatic-related issue.”

“Yeah!” Mellow chimed in. “Elmer’s grandma got lost swimming at sea once.” He pointed to the polar bear next to him, who gave an awkward wave. “Tavie sent out a pod of dolphins to search for her and they found her the very next morning she disappeared.”

Miss Flora nodded. “So, all of you will just have to remember the seventh alpha, Tavie, along with the other six.”

The fennec fox shrugged casually. “What’s the point though? In fact, what’s the point in remembering any of the alphas’ names or what they do?”

“Well, it’s mostly so that when you have a problem in Jamaa you know which alpha to get,” Miss Flora responded politely. “If you’re having trouble being creative, Peck. If you need to resolve a conflict involving more than two people, Liza or Peck. If you need a history lesson, me!” She laughed. “Or Sir.Gilbert. He can also give training and wisdom if he’s in a good mood. If your plants are dying, whether it be your own fault or something else, get Cosmo. Graham if an invention has gone wrong, of course. And Tavi for aquatic-based issues.” She paused and looked at the students darkly. “Don’t get Greely for anything. The phantoms are gone, so there’s literally nothing you can give him. Just don’t.”

All of the other students laughed. Juniper started to wonder about what Greely was doing when he wasn’t studying and spying on phantoms. Like when all the phantoms were gone.

''Find evidence to argue that he still needs to study phantoms?'' She snickered to herself. 

Suddenly, Juniper was spooked by a long, drawn-out ringing noise that was cut off as abruptly as it had started.

Miss Flora threw her feathery wings up into the air. “Oh, would you look at the time!” she exclaimed. “Seems like class is over, a bit too soon personally.” 

All six students exchanged relieved looks, glad to finally get out of the cramped classroom. Juniper, along with everyone else, quickly stood up and made their way to the front of the classroom. The coyote’s legs felt weak and wobbly after she didn’t use them for a long time.

Still standing on one foot, Miss Flora used her beak to pick up a key sitting on her desk. She turned around, now right next to the door. After fumbling around a bit trying to get the key into the keyhole, she managed to open the door, letting out all of the kids.

"Elmer?" she asked the polar bear when he started to pass through the doorway.

Elmer grunted, showing that he was listening.

"Could you maybe sit in your seat next class?" Miss Flora politely asked him.

Elmer grunted affirmatively and lowered his head, not wanting to upset the teacher. 

As Juniper walked through the doorway, a cold air flowed towards her, contrasting heavily with the warm classroom she had just left. Many other students from other classes poured out as well, until a huge mob was traveling to the exit doors. 

''Time to head home.''

= Chapter 2- The most boring chapter to ever exist to showcase our boring (probably everywoman) character =
When Juniper swung open the big exit doors for the school, she was greeted with trees all around her, which made sense since her school was in a clearing near Sarepia Forest. The forest was dimly lit, fireflies and the slightest of sun rays being the only sources of natural light. 

To compensate for that, residents of Sarepia Forest had hung up lanterns and strings of light, which were a gorgeous sight to see. Juniper, however, loved the fireflies. She loved how they seemed to be tiny stars, floating around aimlessly in the forest. The way their abdomens flickered mimicked that of a heartbeat, though more chaotic.

''The heartbeat of the forest,'' she thought to herself. It felt soothing to her, and it was a great way to pass the time. Aimlessly drifting through life, just like the fireflies, without a care in the world. A normal coyote living in just another normal part of the world. She was sad to not stay around for long.

Juniper pranced her way through the forest, trying to get to where her den would be- somewhere on the edges of Jamaa Township. On her way, she saw a pack of wolves curled up beside a campfire, laughing into the flames as they tried making up a scary story to tell. A story involving phantoms, she concluded when she heard ‘slimy cycloptic tentacled beasts’ were mentioned by one of the wolves. Phantoms. No longer a threat, now only reduced to characters in a horror story. 

It felt strange, knowing that a longtime threat now ceased to exist. Juniper was born a bit before the Final War of Jamaa, so she knew some stuff about phantoms. Not much, since other, more skilled animals were out fighting them while she and some of the less skilled ones were sitting in their dens. And… now Jamaa felt a bit empty. No more acts of heroism, no more insane battles, just… peace. 

Calm, mundane peace.

But the truth was, Juniper was hoping for something exciting- something that would never come. She was adventurous and curious. It always felt like something was missing, and staying around in this part of the world wouldn’t solve it.

She sighed and lifted her head, seeing bright rays of sunshine pour in from a clearing in the trees. A light in the tunnel, to get her out of her strange thoughts. 

The coyote walked right into the sunshine and was welcomed by the chatter and conversations of crowds of animals. Some had places they needed to get to, splitting off in multiple different directions, while others decided just to stay around and banter; maybe even trade a bit. Modern-looking wooden buildings were placed all around; they were the shops. A swirled pattern in the design of a mosaic sat in the direct center, with the different paths all converging at this singular spiral.

Jamaa Township, Juniper thought to herself. She looked at the hurrying crowds of animals and took in the noisy atmosphere. ''Pretty busy place.'' And these animals had all kinds of strange and unique designs and patterns. Juniper saw a sky blue arctic wolf with stars on her back, who was complaining to her eagle friend about how hard it was to get rich nowadays.

The eagle, sitting on top of the dome-shaped roof of the diamond shop, nodded away, yellow stripes running down his wings and feathered back.

And they weren’t the only ones- so many animals around her, each dyed with a special color or with a unique pattern. Fur, feather, and scale colors with variety that transcended the rainbow. Swirls, speckles, dots, stripes, stars, splotches, even fire-like patterns. 

Looking at her own, plain, brown fur, Juniper felt like a bit of an outsider. Did she feel jealous? ''Well,'' she reasoned. ''If everyone is special except me, then doesn’t that mean they’re not special and I am?'' 

Juniper was pleased at her smart way to reassure herself, but decided to check the clothing mart. Just in case they had something that looked good on her. She entered the store, took a deep breath, and began trying on accessories.

After an hour or so, she still couldn’t find anything that looked good. Everything article of clothing seemed too unnatural, or didn’t match with her brown fur. She shook her head. ''At least I tried.''

Juniper exited the store, ready to head on back to her den. She took the path that traveled down from the spiral, where there was the arcade, fountain, and alpha headquarters. She lost herself in her thoughts, thinking about when she would like to visit the summer carnival or what Miss Flora would teach them tomorrow. 

Suddenly, among the large hordes of animals, she felt someone bump her by the thigh. Just a slight nudge, but enough to make her whirl around and try to find the culprit.

Looking over her shoulder, Juniper could see a pitch-black arctic wolf that would’ve made them the color of night if it weren’t for the violet swirls on their fur. They wore a fedora and a black spike collar, the spikes extra long, the collars being a classic fashion trend among the wolves.  The arctic wolf had a mysterious aura around them, and when he turned around, shivers were sent down the coyote’s spine.

“Oh did I accidentally bump you,” they said in a masculine voice with a clear lack of emotion. “Sorry.” And so, he turned around and began walking in the opposite direction of Juniper, taking the path to the Temple of Zios.

She stared at the spot where the arctic wolf was moments ago, trying to process what had just happened. ''Okay, that guy was weird,'' Juniper thought to herself. She just couldn’t shake off that chilling feeling she got when looking at him. It didn’t seem natural.

After that encounter, she decided it was best if she hurried home. No need to get caught up in any other weird shenanigans. And besides, the sun was already setting. 

So, she continued on her path, eventually leaving Jamaa Township and encountering a fork in the road. No problem- that was just how they separated the many dens. Once you bought one, you had to remember the path you took to get to it. There were many, many forks in the road, and some animals simply didn’t buy a den for this reason or just kept the directions in their bag. 

But Juniper trained herself to memorize it by heart.

Okay, she thought to herself while walking. First I have to take the left path. Then the middle path. Then left again. Then right. Then middle. 

She continued to recite these directions to herself the entire time she was walking.

''Left, middle, left, right, middle.''

''Left, middle, left, right, middle.''

''Left, middle, left, right, middle.''

She yawned to herself.

''Left.''

''Middle.''

''Left.''

''Right.''

''Middle.''

When Juniper finally reached her small den, she shuffled into her house with the speed and vigor that matched that of a zombie. Without a second thought, tired and weary, she face planted into her bed of mats and pillows, quickly falling asleep.

=== Chapter 3- Introduction to Phantoms ===
Juniper perched her head on one paw, trying to keep awake. Class hadn't even started yet and her eyelids were already beginning to droop close. Like yesterday, standing in front of her was Miss Flora, who, like always, balanced herself on one leg. Today, she pinched a piece of chalk between the upper and lower portion of her beak. She drew a few scribbles onto the chalkboard and dropped the chalk in a little tray, making sure to spit a few times to get the chalk dust out of her mouth. She moved over so that the students could see the board. 

“Now class,” she said with a soothing voice. “Can anyone tell me what the thing I drew on the board is?” She pointed to her doodle on the chalkboard, which seemed to be a misshapen round creature with a singular eye and multiple tentacles.

“A phantom,” Juniper, the fennec fox, and pig groaned with little enthusiasm. The only two who didn't respond were Mellow, who was working at lightning-speed trying to sketch Miss Flora’s drawing before she erased it, and Elmer who kept trying to adjust his chair. He didn’t seem to be very comfortable sitting in such a small seat.

Miss Flora didn’t seem pleased at their lack of energy, whether it be from lack of sleep or lack of willingness to learn. “Oh, come on now students,” she encouraged them. “Just because this is summer school doesn’t mean we can’t have a little bit of fun, right?” She waited eagerly for their responses.

Juniper heard the fennec fox snort in annoyance. “I mean, I’d rather be doing actually fun stuff, like going to that annual carnival or visiting a party. But I guess I’m stuck in here, so oh well.” She shrugged dramatically.

Although she would never say it out loud, Juniper actually disagreed with the fennec fox. Sure, history class was boring, but her normal life was even more boring. Instead of walking around Jamaa and losing herself in her thoughts, maybe she could learn a thing or two here. ''Maybe the teacher was right- maybe I should show more enthusiasm,'' she thought. Miss Flora seemed nice enough, after all.

“Duchess, you are in this classroom for a reason just like everyone else,” Miss Flora told the fennec fox with a serious voice. “Everyone is here because you either did not pay attention in history class in normal school, or because you simply did not take the class. Simple as that.” She looked sympathetically at Juniper the coyote, the spotted pig, and Duchess the fennec fox. “Although, I admit that their ways of teaching history conventionally are a bit… dull. So I’m here to change that.” The flamingo changed back into her usual, cheerful demeanor. She put the chalk back in the little tray.

“Because today, class, we’ll be learning about PHANTOMS!” she exclaimed.

“Oh yes yes yes!” the penguin exclaimed alongside her. He was clearly excited to be here.

Miss Flora smiled. “Well, at least I have one fan in this room.” She took a glance at a small hand-fan near her desk and grabbed it with a claw. “Actually, two!” She laughed at her own pun, while everyone else stared at her with blank expressions. 

“Smart pun, Miss Flora, but can we get back to learning about phantoms?” the penguin said. “Me and Elmer really want to hear about them.” The polar bear next to him grunted in approval.

“Oh! Of course!” She placed the hand fan back on her desk and gestured towards the penguin with a pink wing. “But perhaps you’d like to start us off by telling us what phantoms are, Mellow?”

The penguin nodded and cleared his throat.

“Okay, so, the funny thing is that no one actually knows what they are. They just, appeared one day, and trying to explain more would just be diving into the many theories of where phantoms came from. So I’ll just tell you what they’re made of. A gelatinous substance called phantom goo, which has the power to pollute nature. And these creatures love polluting. And they’re evil, as you might have guessed. Over and over again, they’ve tried to capture Jamaa, and over and over again the alphas have stopped them.” Mellow stopped speaking, seemingly pleased with where his explanation ended.

Miss Flora clapped her wings together, making a soft thump sound. “Yes! Very good Mellow!”

''This guy sure knows his stuff,'' Juniper thought to herself. ''But why is he in summer school in the first place? He already seems to be a natural at this.'' She’d have to ask him about this later after class.

The spotted pig raised a half-hearted hand into the air. 

“Yes, Scooter?” she asked.

“That guy mentioned gelatin for what a phantom is made of,” he said with a bored voice. “Does that mean they’re edible?”

“Oh goodness no!” she exclaimed. “Gelatinous just means that they’re slimy. But glad you paid attention to his explanation, Scooter.” 

Scooter just gave a slight nod, unwilling to show any energy in class.

Juniper suddenly had a question she really wanted to ask the teacher. A question that reminded her of what she was thinking about walking in Sarepia Forest yesterday. It seemed like a kind of rude question though, so she wasn’t sure whether to ask or not. But she needed to know…

“Miss Flora?” the coyote blurted out, shooting her paw into the air. “Why are we learning about phantoms if we don’t even see them anymore?”

The last phantom attack was years ago- in the Final Jamaa War. There, all the phantoms were either slaughtered by alphas and jammers or driven off, sent back to the dimension where they came from. After that, not a single phantom was seen ever again.

The whole room went silent. The flamingo inhaled in a breath and Juniper could tell this was a hard question for her to answer. Finally, she spoke.

“That's a difficult question to answer,” she admitted. “And I’m sorry, but you cannot learn the answer until later, when you’ll understand.”

Juniper sighed and hung her head in a disappointed manner. Miss Flora noticed and tried to calm her.

“Don’t worry. It will not be long until you can learn the answer. But now is the time to learn. So, now let’s take a deep dive into the many different kinds of phantoms.” Miss Flora pointed to the phantom drawing she had made at the beginning of class. “This is the basic phantom.”

Duchess, who was sitting in the desk next to Juniper, leaned towards her to whisper into her ear. 

“Hey look, it was a good question,” she admitted. “This is boring, after all. I’d rather actually be fighting real phantoms. But we can’t, because…” 

Juniper nodded. Surely there was better stuff to do than learning about creatures that didn’t have any bearing on their lives anymore. But she thought over her daily life in her head, and… not really. Shopping wasn’t really fun, parties got boring after a while, trading was only for the hardcore traders who carried value lists in their pockets…

Miss Flora continued speaking. “These are your average phantoms. They use a spin attack and swirl their tentacles around, dealing out rapid attacks. However, their range and eyesight are quite lacking. Does anyone know how we deal with the-”

Suddenly, a blaring siren went off in the classroom, causing Juniper to jump in surprise. Miss Flora looked at the flashing red light stuck on the wall, a look of dismay on her face.

“Well students, it seems like class is dismissed early.”

=== Chapter 4- Polar bears, sirens, and small desks don’t mix well ===
“Awww man! I wanted to learn about the phantoms! Especially my favorite ones,” Mellow pouted. He crossed his flippers together. Elmer put a comforting bear paw on his back.

“I haven’t heard the alarm ring in years,” Miss Flora remarked. “Now what could be such a big deal that they had to pull it now?”

Juniper scanned the sign hanging right above the siren, which read Emergency Report From the Alphas. Reading this, her ears perked up and she wagged her tail. If it involved the alphas then it was almost alway big. The siren was installed in all the dens and buildings of Jamaa and was a call for all jammers to head to the heart of the town, Jamaa Township

Finally!” she exclaimed. “Something interesting that’s about to happen.”

“Eh, who knows. Maybe little Timmy just fell into the well,” Scooter snickered. Juniper couldn’t help but snort at his joke. That little kangaroo joey was always finding his way into sticky situations that he couldn’t get out of.

Miss Flora rolled her eyes. “Amusing. Now, hurry class, we must get to Jamaa Township!” 

The teacher opened the door with a claw. Everyone quickly got out of their seats and headed out the classroom. All except Elmer, who had stuffed himself into the seat and couldn’t get out. He wiggled and wiggled but his giant polar bear body just wouldn’t budge. 

Mellow, waiting for his buddy to get out, noticed.

“Oh no…” he groaned.

He quickly waddled over to Elmer. He wrapped his flippers around Elmer’s body and tried to pull, but didn’t have enough strength to do anything. Everyone else had already gotten out of the classroom.

“Somebody!” the penguin shouted in a panicked voice, jiggling his friend’s body like a locked doorknob. “Help!”

&lt;nowiki&gt;=======&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Juniper was at the back of the line, waltzing through the school hallway with a new bounce in her steps. This was going to be something big. Something interesting. Something… different. And she was all up for being a part of it.

Suddenly, her ears caught the sound of a muffled cry coming from the classroom they just exited. It was masked by the sounds of the siren blaring, but Juniper’s coyote ears knew that it sounded like a cry for help. That was something that couldn’t be ignored.

''Aw, but I wanted to see what all the sirens were about,'' she thought, still curious. But that wouldn’t require immediate action- the cry for help, however, did. 

And so, Juniper abandoned the rest of the group and bolted towards her classroom.

And as soon as she stopped in front of the doorway to the classroom, she knew that this was going to be a sticky situation. A situation close to Timmy the Joey level.

“...What happened here?” Juniper said out loud, even though she already knew the answer. The penguin grunted as he tried pulling a polar bear out, sweating like he was weightlifting at the Olympics. Juniper walked over to Mellow.

Mellow, hearing another person enter the room, dropped his grip on Elmer and turned to look towards Juniper. “Oh thank Mira! Finally, some help!” he said with an exhausted voice. He pointed a flipper towards Elmer. “He’s stuck! These desks are not polar-bear-friendly at all. I’ll have to talk to the teacher about that… But first, I need help!” he cried.

Juniper walked behind Elmer’s back. She inspected the polar bear’s clunky body. “Alright, where do you want me to pull?”

“...the middle of the back?” Mellow answered, seemingly unsure as well. He put his flippers on Elmer’s stomach. “I’ll push up. Elmer will try to too. Ready?”

As gently as she could, Juniper grabbed Elmer’s fur.

One, two, three, GO!”

The three pushed, tugged, wheezed, and huffed, but they still seemed to be making little to no progress.  

“It’s not working!” Mellow huffed. 

“Isn’t there something else we can do?” Juniper asked. “Like…” 

She checked out the polar bear’s beefy paws. They were lazily hanging to his sides, not being put to their full use in any way. And polar bears were known for being quite capable in strength 

”Can’t Elmer just…” Juniper gestured her paw upwards. “Put his paws under the desk and push up or something?” 

Without even a moment of consideration or hesitation, Elmer shook his head. 

“What do you mean the answer’s no?” Juniper said with a hint of annoyance targeted towards him. “You haven’t even tried anything yet!” 

“Heh, that’s Elmer for you,” Mellow interjected, a meek tone to his voice. “He doesn’t want to break the desk.” 

”But if he doesn’t do anything soon, we’ll be stuck here all day!” 

”I know, I know!” 

”And how bad could the damage be? Probably just a couple of scratches or so. To be honest, these desks are banged-up enough already.” 

”Actually, doesn’t that mean the desks are going to break more easily-“ 

”We don’t have any more options! Elmer weighs, I don’t know, a few hundred pounds or something? We can’t lift that much.” 

It wasn’t until Elmer decided to use his two front paws to push up that something major happened. 

There was a loud, sudden crack and the metal frame of the desk broke into two, one half no longer connected to the rest of the desk. Juniper winced as the metal pipes slammed into the ground, making a not so nice sound. It was the sound that told them they would have to come up with a very good explanation for this. The breaking of the desk, however, did the trick, and Elmer wobbled out of his seat.

”O-okay,” Juniper faltered. “That was… worse than I thought.”

Mellow stared at the broken desk, unable to speak. He was sweating all over, thinking of all the ways they could be punished for this. “Worse than you thought?” he spluttered.  He kicked at one of the metal pipes, making it slide across the floor until it touched the wall. “Look at these dents!” He pointed to a half-bent pipe. “Look at the rust! We can’t piece this back together!”

”Are desks really that expensive?” Juniper inquired.

“Well, no, I don’t think so, but still! The people take damaged school equipment seriously.” He fiddled with his flippers agitatedly, and Elmer had to put a paw on him to calm him down. 

The coyote agreed that this was probably serious, but didn’t think Miss Flora would be the kind of teacher to dole out heavy punishments just because the students accidentally damaged school equipment trying to help someone.

“At least the teacher now knows that Elmer needs a special desk…” Mellow mumbled, voice still quivering. “Who’s going to break the news to her?”

“We can tell her about that later,” Juniper said quickly, glancing at the siren that had stopped blaring and flashing. “We need to get to Jamaa Township fast.”

Elmer grunted and walked through the doorway to the school hallway. He got down on all fours and used an arm to point to his back, trying to signal something.

“Oh, he wants us to ride on his back,” Mellow said, decoding the polar bear’s meaning. 

Juniper narrowed her eyes at him, wondering if they were allowed to do something so… primal. “Wait, actually?”

“Yup. Don’t worry, I’ve done this a couple times with him. He doesn’t mind, especially when we’ve just helped him.”

“Okay…” Juniper responded, still a bit unsure. “Can he even carry the both of us? To be honest, I haven’t been eating healthy lately.”

Elmer stared at Juniper directly in the eyes, right through her soul. The areas around his eyes crinkled, and she just knew he was smiling. And then the polar bear gave her a nod. A single, affirmative nod. Suddenly, Juniper was relieved of all doubt after seeing this sincere polar bear reassure her. She inhaled in a breath.

“Okay, let’s get on.”

=== Chapter 3- Special Report from the Alphas ===
Juniper felt the wind ruffle and tousle her brown fur. She used all four of her paws to cling to the polar bear, who was running at top speeds towards the heart of Jamaa. When the breeze blew right by Juniper, it just gave her a new kind of calmness. It melted away stress and worry, and just let her stay in the moment. The moment where it felt like she was flying in the air when she stared at the bright blue sky above her. She threw her front paws into the air and took it all in. Just another bird soaring through the sky, without a care in the world.

“So how do you like it?” Mellow asked Juniper. “I mean, probably a good way to take your mind off the consequences we’re going to get…” He was still stressing over it. 

“It’s great!” she exclaimed. “And I’m sure we’ll be fine. Miss Flora seems nice. She’s not going to be that angry.”

Mellow nodded slowly, still having yet to be convinced. “I guess. But sometimes nice birds can be the ones with the biggest fury…” he muttered to himself.

Juniper raised an eyebrow but otherwise didn’t question it. Suddenly, she remembered the question she wanted to ask him. “Hey, Mellow?”

“Huh?”

“So, I listened to your explanation in class about phantoms,” she said, “and you seem really smart. So why do you need to retake history class in the first place?”

“What?” he asked in confusion. “Oh, no, I’m not retaking it. I’m just making it up, and so is Elmer. Because you see, we only recently moved to Jamaa.”

Juniper was shocked. “Really? Honestly, I didn’t really notice any new people. But maybe that’s just me.”

Mellow nodded. “Yup. Both of us used to live on this isolated iceberg with a few other penguin and polar bear families. But then, we learned about this cool place called Jamaa, where there were animal species of all kinds and lots of great things to do. And we thought, hey, why not move there? Because living on that iceberg was kind of boring, not going to lie.”

“Okay, great reasons, but to be honest Jamaa isn’t that interesting anymore.” Juniper shrugged. “Stuff stopped happening after the phantom wars.”

“Exactly!” Mellow exclaimed. “Another reason I wanted to move here was the history. What other place do you know that has two gods working alongside animals to fight off a foreign threat from another dimension? That’s awesome! I started studying your guys’ history way before we even decided on moving here, because it was that cool.”

“But why study the history at all?” she asked. Juniper couldn’t fathom why you had to learn about stuff that was never going to happen again. “It’s all in the past and isn’t gonna come back. Seems like a waste of time.”

Mellow tried shrugging but decided he didn’t want to loosen his grip on Elmer, and so he just responded with a mumble before speaking again. “It probably sounds cliche, but history repeats itself. I study the past so I can prepare for the future.” He paused for a moment, considering the words that just came out of his mouth. “Hey, that actually sounds like a good quote!” He smiled.

Juniper laughed at the penguin’s enthusiasm. Honestly, he could be right, with the siren alert going off for the first time in years and all of that. Nothing wrong with learning a little bit of background information. And it seemed like an interesting hobby. At least, more interesting than the hobbies the hardcore traders had. Who knew screaming loudly over and over again about trading something really rare counted as a hobby? She joked to herself.

Suddenly, without warning, the polar bear stopped his running and Juniper lunged forward because of inertia. 

“We arrived, didn’t we?” Juniper said, flailing her paws around in an attempt to regain balance.

“Yup.” Mellow hopped off Elmer.

She quickly did the same and surveyed her surroundings. To her left, she saw a banner advertising the summer carnival. ''Honestly I really want to go,'' she admitted to herself. Maybe after school. 

But in the exact center of Jamaa Township, huddling around the swirled mosaic pattern made from small pebbles, were huge crowds of animals of all sorts. And from pretty much everywhere in inner Jamaa. Arctic foxes and wolves from Mt. Shiveer. Lions and giraffes hailing from Appondale. Owls and raccoons who had arrived from Sarepia Forest. Lemurs and monkeys who lived in forests near the Temple of Zios. Even some aquatic animals who could make it onto land, like seals and otters. 

When the siren rang, everyone came.

Juniper, Mellow, and Elmer walked to the large mob of animals, desperate for a good view. “Okay, I did not realize there would be this many people,” Juniper observed. 

“I guess we were late,” Mellow said sheepishly.

Suddenly, in a matter of seconds, Juniper felt her stomach drop as she was thrusted into the air, now decently above the rest of the crowd.

“Alright what-” She looked down and saw Elmer had lifted her into the air with a single arm, just so that she could get a better view. He winked, indicating that this was thanks for caring enough to try to help him.

In Elmer’s other paw was Mellow, who was also lifted at the same altitude as Juniper.

“Great view, don’t you think?” Mellow asked her. Juniper nodded and squinted her eyes, trying to see what was going on. Now that they were above everyone else, there wasn’t anything blocking her view from seeing what everyone was crowding around.

The animals circled a single, bipedal panda who had two black ears on both sides of her head that almost looked like two neatly placed hair buns, as well as a braid that hung down to her waist. The emerald crystal earrings and emerald-green vest she wore seemed to almost foreshadow her mastery in magic. But the markings around her eyes were the most prominent trait about her.

That was mostly because those markings labeled her as an alpha.

“That’s Liza!” Juniper gasped. 

“Boy!” Mellow interjected. “This is like the first time in forever that she’s actually talking to the people here, right in the flesh.”

After the phantoms were driven off, Liza’s endless thirst for adventure was still not quenched, and so, she set off to find more animal heartstones. She only occasionally visited Jamaa now, and that was because the other alphas had begged her to at least return every year. But for her to actually once again give a speech to the jammers without anyone prompting her to?

Juniper twitched her ears and tried to use her coyote hearing to listen in to what Liza was saying.

“...and so what I’m saying here to every single one of you,” Liza said, “is that you must be alert.”

Juniper scratched her. “I guess we weren’t ''that'' late.”

A wave of mutters and confusion spread through the crowd, the full picture not yet fully being given to them. Suddenly, a feeling of dread inched closer and closer to them as Liza continued slowly explaining to them what was currently happening, in order not to overwhelm them too suddenly.

“Now, I do ask you to please stay calm and collected when I tell you this,” she said in a gentle voice, “but thanks to Mira warning us about a strange aura being around Jamaa, we can pass down the information to you too.” She inhaled in a breath and stared at the crowd with sympathetic eyes, pained at what she would have to tell them next.

“Through what is assumed to be the guise of an animal, it seems that we have a phantom living among us, right here, in Jamaa.”

For just a second, it seemed like Juniper’s world had frozen. Her stomach felt queasy and a wave of emotions flooded her. She wasn’t sure what to feel. Shocked? Worried? Scared? Intrigued? Maybe a little bit of all. Mellow, meanwhile, had his mouth wide open in what seemed to be both curiosity and shock.

Like a time bomb barely given a few seconds to go off, the crowd exploded into chaos and confusion. People who had experience with them back in those days of Jamaa screamed with fear. Other, more recent residents were confused, and desperately tried to get someone more knowledgeable to explain the commotion to them. Even more prepared to riot.

“A phantom? Here? After so many years?” a bunny whimpered, a dazed look on their face. “What do they want? Another chance at taking our lives?”

“Back again?” a monkey hollered while clutching the sides of their head. “This is bananas! We, we aren’t prepared for another battle!”

“It won’t matter much anyway,” a lynx said through gritted teeth. “We’ll check every animal here! Interrogate them! We’ll weed out that phantom in no time, before they can take even one of us!”

“Uhhh, what’s a phantom?” a young cougar asked innocently. “And why are they so bad? I thought phantom meant ghost. Ghosts don’t seem that bad.”

Liza watched all the nasty words and threats being flung around carelessly like food in a food fight. She narrowed her eyes and banged her staff onto the ground, making a low, resonating sound that brought the crowd’s attention back onto her. 

“Everyone, please calm down!” she said firmly. “We do not know what the phantom wats with us, but just because there’s a single enemy living within our home doesn’t give you a reason to start accusing everyone you see! This is how the phantoms try to break the bonds between us, remember?” Her voice softened and she relaxed her grip on her staff. 

“Do not worry. I have hurried back to Jamaa simply because of this. I will work with the other alphas to find the intruder, swiftly and safely. I have told you all this because I want each of you to look out for yourself, your friends, and your neighbors.”

“But what if our friends or neighbors are the-” Liza silenced an eagle with a gesture of her hand.

“Put your trust in your friends and neighbors. It’ll be more worth it if you do. Now, I would like all of you to be alert, aware of your surroundings, aware of what a phantom is.” She glanced at the younger animals in the crowd, who mostly seemed to be yawning and completely unfazed by this news. “Because I can tell that many of you haven’t been teaching them about them. Study up on phantoms. Please. It will help us later, for it seems like the phantoms aren’t completely gone yet.” She stared at the crowd again, with a serious but hopeful look in her eyes.

“Thank you for coming to listen. If we work together, the dangers to Jamaa may finally be put to rest. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to alert the animals of outer Jamaa on this as well.” 

And with a swirl of lights and emerald-colored dust, she was gone.

And so, the animals started to slowly dissipate from the crowd, most of the animals still mumbling and muttering to themselves or their family members about the alert. No words were off-limits when describing the phantom spy, and some were ones that would have you thrown out of the Mt. Shiveer Hot Cocoa Hut in an instant if you dared to speak them. And the workers would be so displeased with you they would start charging you extra for each mini marshmallow you put in your hot cocoa.

Elmer, who was now rather tired from holding a coyote and a penguin, set both of them down on the ground. Mellow quickly waddled over to him and whispered a quick summary of the whole thing into his ear. 

The huge polar bear suddenly lost his balance and fell back onto his bottom. He stared at the ground, not even trying to look up and face the news. 

None of them could speak. Juniper’s eyes stared directly into Mellow’s. She felt dizzy and unstable, thinking back to last night when she bumped into that peculiar arctic wolf. Finally, she found her words again.

“Mellow?”

“Uh huh,” he said, still shaking a bit from the shock and chaos of it all.

“It looks like history class is gonna finally pay off.”

=== Chapter 4- Morning Mail ===
Juniper blinked her eyes open, hearing the ring sounds of an alarm clock that blared next to her. Her eyelids felt like they were going to close shut any moment, and her legs and muscles ached.

She groaned and flopped over on her pile of mats before slamming a paw down on the clock. It stopped ringing, and now Juniper was left with a moment of serenity and quietness to decide whether or not to get up. 

After listening to Liza speak, Juniper didn’t remember much after that. The significance of the events after the announcement paled in comparison to the speech itself, and she just couldn’t get the news out of her mind. All she knew was that she walked for a bit around Jamaa before going home and settling down, only to find that she couldn’t sleep. Too much had happened. Too much to process.

Juniper stared at the clock blankly. It still felt too early to think clearly. She looked at the hands of the clock and saw the small hand positioned on the six, and the large hand positioned somewhere between the seven and the eight.

''I guess I still have some time before I need to get ready for school'', she thought. 

And so, Juniper continued to stare at the clock, an empty look on her face. She didn’t bother trying to go back to sleep, and just tried to sort out her thoughts in her mind. She thought about her classmates; the phantom spy; the weird wolf with a weird aura; what all of this meant for Juniper herself.

Should she try to investigate the wolf further?

''He could be anywhere by now though'', she thought dejectedly to herself. 

Prepare for battle against the phantoms? 

''Not even sure if there’s gonna be a battle, plus who’s gonna train me anyway?''

Learn more about the phantoms?

''Actually, that doesn’t sound too bad.'' Miss Flora was about to teach them about phantoms after all, had it not been for the siren going off at the perfect time. And besides, that would count as some form of preparation, at least.

Okay, that was the plan. With a new flow of vigor and enthusiasm, she immediately hopped out of bed, ready to finally begin her day. She smiled.

And then the muscle aches started to kick in.

''Ouch.'' She rubbed her thigh with her snout, feeling around for the sore. She even waved one leg off the ground, flexing it a few times to determine how bad it was. ''What was I even doing last night?'' 

She then remembered her walks. ''Oh right.''

Juniper decided the aches were bearable and could probably wear off in an hour or two. So, she walked over to her fridge, grabbed the fridge handle with her jaws and opened it, and prepared to get something to eat.

There were a few slices of watermelon she had bought on… well, who knows what day… that caught her eye the quickest. Probably because the rest of her food stash were frozen lizards and frogs and she felt a bit guilty eating them when other animals were literally raising them as pets. No one would see her in her own den, but still. 

Juniper had just about set the watermelon down on the table when she heard the flapping of wings outside, and something heavy landing. A few seconds later, there was a knock on her door.

She sighed. Not even a single bite. 

The coyote walked over to the door and clamped the doorknob with her teeth. She turned her head to the left and pushed. The door didn’t budge. 

''Oh wait, wrong direction.'' Doorknobs were unnecessarily frustrating for her, especially when she didn’t have opposable thumbs. She could practically hear the invisible pandas, monkeys, lemurs, and koalas laughing at her. 

She turned her head right and pushed, hearing a small click sound as the door swung open.

Standing in front of her was a blue and red striped eagle with a satchel on his back. 

“Morning mail for you!” he said cheerfully.

Juniper tilted her head. “Mail?”

“Yup!” he chimed. “Mail! For Juniper Canyonpaw!” He slid the satchel off his back with a wing and reached in with a claw, ruffling the papers around. Finally, the eagle pulled it out of his bag, an envelope pierced by the talon. He scanned the letter’s address and gave a satisfied nod.

“This one’s coming to you all the way from Coral Canyons,” he informed her.

“Coral Canyons?” Juniper said with a look of shock on her face, before settling into the realization. “Oh wait, probably from my parents. Almost forgot about those monthly letters.”

“Mmm,” the eagle said. He slid the envelope off his talon with his beak, and leaned forward before dropping it on the ground in front of Juniper.

“There you go, dear lady!” he said gracefully.

“Oh, um.” The coyote glanced down at the punctured envelope. “Thanks?”

The eagle nodded. “No worries. Just doing my job! Oh, and speaking of which…” He spread his wings. “I still have mail to deliver! Goodbye!”

And so, with a few flaps of his wings and a convenient gust of wind, he was gone.

Juniper shrugged and carried the envelope inside with her mouth.

She pinned the envelope down to the floor with a paw and used her teeth to rip the flap open. Juniper spat the loose flap out of her mouth and looked ''at the now-opened envelope. There was a single letter inside, which had a hole near the top. Using a paw, she gently slid it out of the envelope and began reading.''

''Dear Juniper,''

''Hi! It’s been a while since you’ve moved to a den in Jamaa Township, and we know we’ve been asking you this since the first letter we’ve sent. But, like the concerned parents we are, we just want to know if you’re still doing O.K. Is school alright? Other animals treating you just fine? How about friends? Speaking of friends, Snickety and Sleek really miss you, and even admitted that their games just aren’t the same without you. So maybe come visit us again? If you have time available, that is :). We’ll write back soon, and hope to see you again!''

''Love,''

''      Mom and Dad''

''P.S. You don’t have to write back unless something’s really concerning you. We know how much fun you’re having here!''

Juniper  looked at the letter with a sad and longing look. ''Fun?'' She thought to herself, thinking about all the recent events. ''Yeah. Sort of. It only started to get interesting yesterday.'' She walked over to the dining table and started munching on her breakfast watermelon.

Honestly, she kind of wanted to go back and visit her parents. And Snickety and Sleek. Those two were fun. Maybe it would be in the plans one day, when she had multiple days free to visit Coral Canyons and see them again. Not anytime soon though, as long as the phantom threat and summer school were still around…

Juniper took the last bite of watermelon, having shaved off every bit around the rind. Small pieces of watermelon and watermelon juice littered the table and floor, as well as her face. She wiped the wet underside of her snout with a paw.

“Yuck,” she cringed when the sticky juice got on her fur. She would just have to wash it off in a pond or river, because right now…

Juniper checked the alarm clock by her bed again. The long hand had moved to between the nine and the ten.

''Still a good hour and then some to get to school,'' she thought optimistically to herself. 

Juniper got up and opened the door, still spending a minute or so fumbling with the doorknob. She pushed it open though, and followed the dirt path that led outside her house and to the rest of Jamaa.

= Chapter 5- Late? =
Turned out Juniper’s clock was lying to her. 

“What?” Juniper shouted in disbelief, looking at the clock on the Jamaa Township bulletin board. 

7:30

She brushed away some pinned papers and posters, just to make sure her eyes weren’t deceiving her.

7:30.

The coyote shook her head. ''Yeah, pretty sure I didn’t take an entire forty minutes leaving my den''. She sighed. ''Looks like the clock went rogue again.'' 

Now she only had thirty minutes to get to school. At top speeds, she bolted towards Sarepia Forest, startling some animals in the result. They glared at her with suspicious and annoyed looks.

“Hey! Stop pushing!”

“Where are you off to in such a hurry? It’s summer!”

“I’m telling you, no sane animal would be this squirrely. This has to be the phantom. Come back! I’ve got some questions for you!”

“Sarepia Forest, eh?” an elephant with pink spots had said to her when she was about to cross the bridge. “I knew the newly-released movie at the theater was good, but wow, this is a whole new level.”

“I’m not going to watch the movie,” she calmly explained. “I’m going to school!”

“Summer school? Feel bad for you. Hope it goes well though.”

Juniper nodded and continued on her way.

She trotted through Sarepia Forest, gazing at the lights and fireflies while walking; never stopping even for a second. While her eyes might have been on the sights of the forest, her mind couldn’t stop thinking about one word.

''Late. Late. Late. Late. Late. I’m gonna be so late if I keep walking like this.''

Juniper quickened her pace a little. A minute later, she quickened her pace even more. The muscle aches came back, but she ignored them. Another minute passed, and, still unsure of her walking speed, quickened her pace again. She was really kicking up the dirt below her now.

Not two minutes later, she broke into a full-on run.

Muscle aches or no muscle aches, she had to get to school on time no matter how her legs were feeling. 

The wind struck her in the face, making her want to yell out loud. Not because she was in pain or anything, but just because she felt so… alive. 

“I’M NOT GONNA BE LATE!” she screamed to no one in particular. Her throat burned after she shouted that, but whatever. She did a sharp right turn into the woods, a small path created by the cleared out trees. Juniper could just barely see the schoolhouse at the end of the path, resting in a clearing in the forest. The light that shone down on it gave it a rustic and isolated feel. A little house in the woods it would be, if it wasn’t so big. 

An orange flag with a paw design was attached to a long pole. It flapped in the wind, making sharp whipping sounds.

Juniper didn’t even stop running. She looked behind her, checking to see if anyone else was coming. Didn’t look like it.

''Either I’m really early or really late.''

Suddenly, the coyote’s shoulder slammed against someone. It was a someone, because that someone made a squealing sound upon impact.

“Oof!” Juniper grunted. Her body bounced off and she lost her balance, beginning to fall backwards. Luckily, she planted her foot back just in time, and she regained balance again. She sighed in relief.

The one she bumped into wasn’t so pleased though. “Hey! What was that for?”

Juniper looked right in front of her and saw a spotted pig rubbing his cheek with a hoof. 

“Sorry!” she said quickly. “Sorry, uh…” She thought to herself, trying to remember. What was his name again? Sergeant? Sherbet? Scooter?

“Scooter!” she said out loud.

The pig looked mildly miffed. “Yeah, that’s my name. And what’s yours anyway? Speedy McSpeedster?”

“Well it’s actually-” Juniper tried to politely correct him.

Scooter snorted. “I was kidding. I remember you, Juniper. I remember everyone’s names. But how come you were running so fast? Almost thought phantoms were after you.”

“I just didn’t want to be late for class, and how come YOU’RE patrolling around the school?” she shot back. “Isn’t the classroom supposed to be inside?”

Scooter threw back his head and scoffed, one of his ears flopping to the side. “Why, phantom lookout! What else?” He scanned the woods with narrowed eyes, even doing a 360 turn. “That phantom spy could be anywhere in Jamaa. In Jamaa Township. In the Kimbara Outback hospital. Even in your HOUSE.” He whirled around to stare Juniper dead in the eyes, somehow trying to scare her.

“O-kay,” she said, unfazed. “My house doesn’t even have anything good anyway. Just some food, pillows, and papers.” She looked around her, not seeing a single animal in sight. “Am I early or late?”

But Scooter paid no attention and continued rambling on. “But I believe they have special reason to be creeping around the school, you see. Miss Flora’s teaching us about phantoms today, right? Including ways to defeat them, right? And this spy is a phantom, right? Who doesn’t want to be defeated, right?” He put emphasis on each ‘right’, convinced that he was getting somewhere.

“Scooter, it’s summer,” Juniper huffed. “If they were planning to attack a schoolhouse, it would’ve been at least while school was still in session. I’m not even sure if phantoms have ever heard of summer school before. Pretty sure they’re not gonna be planting phantom troops around a house in the middle of the forest.”

Scooter glared at her, intent on shooting back with a witty remark or quip. But then his gaze lessened and he gave in. He sat on his back feet and shrugged. “Yeah, you’re probably right. I’m just trying to save my bacon here, alright? Gotta watch out for the phantoms to make sure they don’t get the upper hand.  If the phantoms launch another full-scale invasion then I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t hesitate to eat the delicious animals first instead of capturing them.” He pointed a hoof to himself. “I’M the delicious animal! Do you know how many pork jokes have been made at my expense?”

“...too many?” Juniper replied, unsure on how else to respond.

“Exactly!” Scooter exclaimed. “They’ll capture me, grab the ol’ Chef Goop’s Best Ways to Cook 40+ Different Species of Animals- Deliciously Nasty Edition recipe book from their non-existent library, dust it off, go to the Pig chapter, and start reading. But then they’ll rip the book apart, because who even knows if phantoms can read. They’ll just invent their own recipe and throw me in a tub of phantom goop soup! Toast me above an open fire! Cackle to themselves about the meal they’re hav-”

“Okay okay!” Juniper yelled, getting more anxious by the second. “I get it! I get it! Can we at least go inside first? I still have no idea if I’m early or late!”

Scooter mumbled a bit and headed through the great big doors of the school. Juniper followed right behind him, and together, they walked to their classroom.

They entered the classroom, Scooter shutting the door behind them, and Juniper was surprised to see the rest of their classmates already there. Duchess had a small, green pod on her desk that she rolled from one side of her desk to the other, a bored expression on her face. The pod was spiky and round, and Juniper noted that it looked identical to those fruits she saw growing in trees. Nobody ever told her what they were, though,

Mellow and Elmer were hanging around in the desks in the back, with Elmer now resorting to sitting next to his still-broken desk. The penguin, meanwhile, was fidgeting around and mumbling to himself. Maybe he was still trying to come up with a good explanation for the broken desk. 

The thing that surprised Juniper the most, however, was that the chalkboard still had the chalk phantom doodle, and everything was arranged nicely in its place, just like how Miss Flora had left it yesterday when class ended abruptly. 

Oh, and also the fact that Miss Flora wasn’t there.

Juniper stared at the empty spot where Miss Flora should have been standing. “So, if the teacher isn’t here, that means I’m not late, right?”

“Mmm,” everyone muttered with uncertainty.

'''Yuna Hanamura''' is a major supporting character of a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. She the distant cousin of [[Locaster Helios|Locaster]] and is fifty percent of a shadow demon. She is [[Shay Hanamura|Shay's]] older sister and an enhanced herbalist who helps the group of shard users, including his brother and distant cousin to reunite the gems. Due to her high intelligence and efficient potion making, she is a profound potion and poison maker.  

== History ==
Yuna was born in the southern part of Leiden with her brother. In the area they lived in, crops were rich during the summer times and were easy to harvest for heavy winters that were commonly used in order to make ends meet. Despite being at a rather low status, Yuna's family was a bright one and ensured that she would have a better future and pursue education. 

During this time, her brother, Shay, was born and Yuna had begun multi-tasking with pursuing what she wanted to be and learning how to be a proper sibling in order to have a strong bond with him. When he got older, Yuna started showing affection towards him and the two started to have an unusually good sibling relationship without arguing with one another about pointless things. Due to their strong bond, Yuna and Shay often times worked together without much issues despite some minor bickering they do and some small play-fights they occasionally had. 

The both of them were described as hard workers while being the opposite personality wise, as Yuna was a more gentle and carefree child who often worked hard with little interest in adventure, while Shay was an adventurous yet quiet and determined to try anything new that comes his way, but he too also was a hard-worker, being described as a keen intellect for his age.     

At the age of twelve, Yuna started to grow an interest in potions and herbs after her mother had treated her brothers wound with a specific kind of ointment that healed his scar up in an instant. She began learning from her mother at first by studying with the books her mother had and eventually learned more about herbs and potions in schools, while her brother studied about the military due to his dreams of becoming a high-ranking individual in the army due to his infatuation with the military.       

Though, at this age, her demon abilities started to develop much earlier than expected due to female demons developing much quicker than male demons. Soon realizing her new abilities and features,  Yuna was expected to cover her claws with gloves and her horns with a cape that had a hood attached in order to not get spotted by guards due to the peak of demons being murdered solely because of their species because of the rate of homicides rising in both Leiden and Myria. Even though she was rather peeved by this new rule, she was understanding of her parents motivations to protect her so she could pursue what she longed to be, and not have her life ended so early all because of her species.         

Despite this, Shay and Yuna had a fairly good childhood without much problems or difficulty with one another or having strained relationships with either one of their parents, the both of them having high amounts of intelligence with bright minds. Unfortunately, one day Yuna and Shay were allowed to play outside for sometime, but accidentally exceeded the time limit from when they need to go back, and once they had arrived home, their parents were murdered by soldiers of Leiden, specifically the Demon Task Force division that was sent to hunt down the mysterious [[Damion Halloreen|shadow demon and spirit hybrid]] that had been killing citizens from both Myria and Leiden.          

Yuna was spotted by the guards without her gloves or hood on, and was mistaken as the hybrid the division was looking for, and quickly begun to chase her and her brother, constantly having to use her magic in order to tackle some of the guards down to move farther away from the southern district, but due to the energy required to use larger and larger spells, Yuna eventually got tired and the siblings were surrounded by many of the troops in the Demon Task Force. Before they were about to seize Yuna solely, Shay had created a loud bird squawk that resulted in the task forces ears bleeding and causing them to retreat from the area.               

Due to the squawk, Yuna only had partial ear pain for a couple of days, but unfortunately for her brother, he lost his hearing entirely in order to save her from getting caught by Leiden's guards. Yuna had started to harden herself and attempted to learn things she never initially had done before. Instead of talking to Shay normally, she had adapted into writing her responses to him in a little notebook while studying sign language and teaching it to Shay.                 

After some time, though, he had gotten more fluent with sign language and was able to read lips to anyone that was talking to him, being able to communicate with his sister while still having to adjust to new accustoms. The squawk had also damaged Shay's vocal cords and restricted his speech, meaning he can only say a couple words at a time without feeling excruciating pain. As Shay started to adjust to sign language, Yuna begun to live her life normally after the both of them had built their shelter, Syuna, which would house and keep them safe for a long time.                  

== Appearance ==

=== Gacha Club Model ===
''(NOTE: this character has two appearances: one Animal Jam model, and one Gacha Club model. The Gacha Club model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam Models and Gacha Club Models are used to show them both In animal jam and as an actual person.)''

Yuna is a tall woman of Tswana and Japanese descent with a lean stature, being taller than Ashton by one inch and Locaster by six inches. She has wavy, silver hair that extends to her lower back and two different colored eyes, one eye being white and one eye being a light gray tint with two black stars in the center. On top of her head is a flower crown with light blue and white roses held by thin branches that are not visible.   

Yuna wears a black cloak that covers most of her body with a light blue and white bodysuit-type shirt and a long, white skirt that covers her legs entirely. Underneath, she wears white socks that go up to her thighs and brown geta sandles.   

When she reveals her demon abilities, two horns are now present on the sides of her head and black, enlarged claws with purple outlining form on her hands. In this state, her powers enhance to a great extent.   

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Yuna's Animal Jam Model consists of a tall arctic wolf with a dark gray outer fur and lighter gray inner fur with white eyes and black patterns on her fur.   

Yuna dons wears a white flower crown, a black mysterious cloak, an epic feathered tail and black elf bracelets on her wrists.  

== Personality ==
Yuna, despite usually staying inside her home of Syuna, is described as a very gentle and carefree woman with a welcoming aura, a great usage of her own words and a bright mind. She has been described as intelligent and educated by her brother and many of the members in the group, being able to gather information in the blink of an eye and is rather descriptive with what she says. According to Shay, Yuna is very protective to those around her, especially her close companions and family, mainly [[Shay Hanamura|her brother]] and [[Locaster Helios|Locaster]], and shows a motherly love to the group.        

Even though she is a rather brave and fearless soul, she has demonstrated to have a fear for scary stories, as she had gotten frightened when Veena explained the legend of [[Shítǐ|Mr. No-Face]], or sometimes referred to as the dark entity, opposite from her younger brother, who takes a keen interest in horror stories without flinching. She is often teased for her scared demeanor, but justifies her fear after implying she has intrusive thoughts about sorts of horror stories that she heard when she was a child. According to Shay, Yuna has an odd fear of jack-o-lanterns because of their scary faces that are carved into them or anything scary for that matter.        

Yuna has demonstrated to get extremely flattered when shown chivalry by any individual, immediately being charmed at any sort of affection being shown directly to her and seemingly takes a keen interest in mannerisms from those around her. According to Shay, Yuna is a very easily smitten person and is able to get swayed with by just a few words. Though, she is sometimes described as rather quiet and often prefers to work with close friends or simply with her brother. She has shown to lack some social skills and sometimes stammers on her words out of nervousness or simply being smitten.          

Being a herbalist, Yuna has an extended knowledge about herbs and potions. She is sometimes described as Shay as being obsessed with them due to her endlessly researching new potions and herbs, causing her to stay inside and somewhat act like a recluse. Yuna mainly enjoys researching and often does so alone so no one can distract her, and as noted by [[Hideko Inazuma|Hideko]], she is somewhat of an introvert despite interacting with the group when necessary. Along with being a profound healer, she was shown to be skilled enough to remove the drug Akuji had given to Locaster during their time detained in Lyakon.              

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' As a healer, Yuna is both an exceptional combatant and skilled healer. Taking an interest in potions and herbs when she was younger, she often includes those skills whenever in combat due to her having the incapability of inflicting physical attacks and opts to use her magic and herb skills combined to make up for her inexperience in some forms of combat. She has also exemplified to have great navigational skills, being able to sense the Lyakonian soldiers coming from each direction in order to tell the designated members patrolling the area if they are planning on an ambush. Yuna has proven to be more of a defense and navigator than an offense fighter and is often attributed to when having to heal others.     

'''Immense Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Like most demons, Yuna has proven to be incredible fast and agile, speeding over to Locaster after his wings were ripped off in order to asist him and dodging the Lyakonian soldier's bullets while being injured. She was also able to evade most of Lilith's attacks from when they were trying to separate both her and Arcana from their soul. She has also proven to have fast reflexes, dodging most of the Lyakonian soldiers attacks and managing to surprise attack them without much difficulty and out-pacing Crow in his steps.     

'''Immense Strength:''' Despite having weak arms, Yuna possesses inhuman-like strength. His is shown when she was able to land on the ground with ease after falling off of Shay's back due to him getting shot. She has also proven her strength when she nearly punches Akuji in the face, leaving a small dent on his cheek after. She was able to nearly take out Crow without difficulty, almost landing a severe hit that could have killed him, but missed.      

'''Immense Durability:''' Despite not being the strongest, Yuna's body has proven to be incredibly durable, withstanding fatal attacks from Cassian after she attempts to shield Shay from getting hurt further and managed to overcome a bullet wound to the leg, still having the ability to run while having a large wound.       

'''Unlimited Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Yuna possesses an incredibly high level of both stamina and endurance, never getting tired or exhausted when in combat and manages to remain in the same physical and psychological state. She was able to outnumber waves of attacks being launched at her by Crow as if it were nothing. She showed near complete immunity to one of The Dark Entity's many attacks that would have killed her and managed to remain standing for the remainder of the battle.             

'''Tactical Intellect:''' Studying herbology and potions since she was twelve, Yuna displays to have incredible intelligence and coordination skills. He was able to use the information from many books and knowledge from her brother in order to make potions and sometimes explosives to coordinate her attacks against her opponents. Yuna was able to successfully inject a lethal poison into Shítǐ in order to weaken him and was able to correctly guess many of his next attacks when doing so. With her knowledge in herbs, she managed to make a potion that would heal up most of Locaster's wounds after Akuji had ripped his wings off.               

'''Healing:''' Like Hideko, Yuna's blood contains unique properties, where if she feeds someone a portion of her blood, she is able to heal them in an instant. Though, larger wounds tend to require larger quantities in order to heal entirely.                

== Magic Abilities ==
'''Unbrakinesis:''' Being half shadow demon, Yuna has proven to have powerful unbrakinesis. She is able to control masses of dark magic, seen when she is fighting off the Lyakonian soldiers by summoning large black vines in order to slam them down. 

'''"Berserk":''' Yuna, like Locaster, has a "berserk" form when she fully awakens her powers, growing two horns and claws. Her abilities increase immensely after she activates her "berserk" form: In this form, she gains ink-like claws, longer horns and markings on her face. She was able to knock down Crow effortlessly when using this form and nearly managed to kill him. She does not use her berserk form as much because of how much energy it requires. 

'''Demonic Entity:''' Though only displayed once, Yuna has the ability to summon a drawn-like demon entity with large horns and white scribbly eyes that was able to drain the energy out of the Lyakonian soldiers. Though, this spell requires extreme concentration and energy. The entity has the capability of making a shockwave energy blast via a large screech it can deliver, but this ability still has yet to be seen in the story. 

== Weaknesses ==
'''Overuse:''' Yuna is prone to overusing her magic without realizing, especially using larger spells that require large amounts of energy to use.

'''Drawing credits go to xxayoaprilxx or known on the wiki as XxLucidFøxesxX. Thank you so much for drawing him!'''

'''Misaya Myat''' is a minor character in a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. Living in the North Desolates of Azuren, he runs the Luckyside Tavern that situates on top of a steep landslide who often serves his customers without charge. He is later revealed to be a mist shard user, but does not exhibit his powers often.  

== History ==
Little is known about Misaya's past, as he never seems to bring up much of his origins, let alone where he had first came from. He does not have recollection of who his parents were and how he had been brought to the Desolates, but it is implied he never had parents, but was created by an unknown source that had mixed with ghost magic. Misaya is a primordial demon that wandered Azuren for over thousands of years without aging, capturing many people and turning them into his arms that spawn out of his back by absorbing their souls for amusement, causing his arms to have mouths. Due to this, he can only see and hear his arms unless he snaps his fingers to make them visible and hearable.  

During his time in Azuren and roaming the world as a whole, Misaya settled in a steep landslide in the Northern Desolates, full of resources and much of what he needed and started the Luckyside Tavern, both rendering as a place to work and live in without having to pay for anything, happily working while being resistant to those trying to pay him due to him not wanting to take anyone's money, but sometimes accepts it in order to save it to someday visit one of the Five Kingdoms. During the group's time in the Desolates, they had stopped by to have something to eat and drink before going back to their current mission after the desolates resources were slowly starting to deplet. 

According to [[Yuna Hanamura|Yuna]], Misaya is a ghost demon, a rare and unique type of demon that has the ability of eternal youth and being incapable of dying, something that is uncommon in many demon species who are able to live for long amounts of time, but are not entirely immune to death. His abilities are described to be as dangerous as a shadow demons when their abilities are awakened fully.    

== Appearance ==
''(NOTE: this character has two appearances: one Animal Jam model, and one Gacha Club model. The Gacha Club model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam Models and Gacha Club Models are used to show them both In animal jam and as an actual person.)''

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Misaya is a tall man of both Burmese and Filipino descent with somewhat gray skin and ghostly white eyes that were able to terrify any individual with only one stare, but is described as "fascinating" by people who have met him. He has long, gray hair tied in a braid, although when let down it reaches his shoulders. Underneath his left eye is one beauty mark and on the sides of his head are two, off-hued blue horns with light blue arms that spawn out of his back. Each one of his arms have dark blue mouths with teeth shaped like needles. 

Misaya dons a more casual outfit than the rest of the characters in the series. Around his neck, he wears a light blue scarf with layers that stick down from his shoulders and a cool blue turtleneck with darker blue ending sleeves. Misaya also sports light gray sweatpants and dark blue combat boots. Under his scarf is a mist shard that is attached to the middle of his neck.  

In his ghost form, his body shifts into a white, translucent body with multiple arms and holes as eyes. On his neck are a mountain of tinted purple flowers. In a smaller variant, however, he looks similar to Veena's spirit form and uses this to enact as her.  

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Misaya's Animal Jam model consists of a gray colored arctic wolf with white eyes, a peach underbelly and gray star patterns all over his body. On his head are two, light blue horns that sit on the top of his head instead of the sides.

Misaya dons a ghostly worn spiked collar with a blue worn blanket that slouches over his back. On his ankles are a navy-like colored elf bracelets, and on his tail has a blue elf tailed armor with darker blue gems. His arms are shown to be hidden in his Animal Jam Model, but when he snaps his fingers, they become visible. 
== Personality ==
Little is known about Misaya's personality. Though, in many scenes, he is depicted as rather polite and calm when working his job at the Luckyside Tavern, usually serving food and drinks with a smile on his face while resisting the offer of being paid when customers offer to due to him having all the resources he needs. He, in a sense, lives rent free, not having to pay any bills or having to make salary to make ends meet with a hatred of relying on others for money because he does not want to be portrayed as greedy or a user, and seems to be more reliant on the environment around him rather than being reliant on money. Due to his charming demeanor, he manages to attract customers with ease because of the way he sets up his environment in the tavern he owns.  

Misaya has demonstrated to be an expert when it comes to bartending, being able to mix up certain drinks to concoct something new, similar to that of making potions while having the capability to cook good food according to many who have been to his tavern. Due to being a self-made individual, he has little to no difficulty surviving in extreme conditions, since he cannot die or age by any means and was able to survive many diseases that were seen as deadly because of being a ghost demon. Misaya has also shown to be generous and rather hospitable, allowing Locaster and the group inside of his tavern when it was raining heavily and even allowing them to stay in a spare room for a while until the rain will stop.     

He demonstrates that he sees himself as a god because of his eternal youth because of his immortality, but he has been shown to act agitated when his arms begin to argue with one another, usually saying "Tumahimik ka!" (lit. "be quiet" in filipino) to silence them in order to not deal with their antics. Being the sole controller of his arms, he has been described to have fluid movements when using his abilities. To many villagers, Misaya is portrayed as rather majestic and beautiful because of his youthful appearance, being able to captivate those with just a stare to the eyes and his friendly tone in voice. Due to his open mind, Misaya can express his opinions freely without any consequence or fear of being persecuted by any officials due to the place he lives in.      

Even though he is rather friendly on the surface when working at his tavern, Misaya is a rather cold and distant individual and shows little to no attachment for those around him. He shows no interest in those around him and demonstrates to get easily bored or unmotivated in less than a minute: He can come off as prudent to those he generally dislikes, and often gives rude glares to them. Misaya is a very boastful individual, often bragging at times on how he can live forever while Locaster can only live for a short time and get killed.          

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' Despite appearing harmless on the surface as a mere bartender, Misaya has been shown to be a very powerful, yet dangerous demon. Even though he can turn into a seemingly harmless ghost to pose as a spirit from the spirit world, he was able to possess many people and take their soles with ease in order to transform them into one of his many arms he has by using deception and posing as someone rather innocent and eager only to fully take advantage of them in the end by gaining their trust and taking their souls to turn them into one of his many arms. 

Due to having multiple arms not being viewable or hearable to the public eye unless he snaps his fingers, he is able to snatch and steal people without getting caught, further exemplifying his powers. He was able to easily have [[Ashton Khan|Ashton]] in a chokehold position without difficulty by using his arms to grab his throat and torso, despite him being an extremely skilled mercenary, and was able to bypass [[Shizuka Ikami|Shizuka's]] ability of mind manipulation by nearly crushing her left arm when doing so and almost crushing her body into shrubs.   

'''Apathy:''' Though, not entirely emotionless, Misaya has demonstrated to be somewhat apathetic. He is incapable of feeling emotions like grief and sadness, but uses this to his advantage by being able to calmly process any situation without much panic and remains in the same mental state after doing so. Due to his apathy, Misaya finds it more than helpful allows him to come up with a solution easily without having to stress out or start crying. Due to this, he was able to kill many demon hunters that were in an attempt to kill him. Though, he is still able to express other emotions as he is not completely apathetic, such as being delighted whenever he gets customers at his tavern.    

'''Immense Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' As a demon, Misaya has demonstrated to be very fast and extremely quick on his feet. Unlike most demons, he is able to enhance his speed through his arms by extending them and jumping from one place to the next without having to use his legs. According to Ashton, Misaya was able to catch up to him, even though he was going at a rather slow pace. Misaya is fast enough to outrun many common demon species, including Veena, who has demonstrated to be an extremely fast runner despite not being a demon. Due to his speed and his boost via his arms, he was able to catch many demon hunters without having to fight them hand-to-hand or  face-to-face. 

His reflexes are equally as fast and managed to avoid getting hit by a falling tree, along with being able to evade Hikages shadow vines she had sent after him. 

'''Immense Strength:''' Misaya has shown to possess an incredible amount of strength, throwing Shizuka off of him in merely a minute and kicking Locaster into a tree effortlessly. His strength is also exemplified when he went head on with Yuna, nearly fracturing her wrist when she was about to inject poison in him to hinder his abilities.  

'''Unlimited Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Misaya has shown to have unlimited stamina and endurance, having a higher level than [[Damion Halloreen|Damion]], a founding demon himself and [[Hideko Inazuma|Hideko]], one of the strongest mercenaries in his village. He had managed to remain in the same mental state and bodily shape he was in the moment he starts to engage in combat. Misaya is also able to resist damage from natural disasters because of his ghostly abilities.     

'''Keen Intellect:''' Being alive for over thousands of years, Misaya is an intelligent and very knowledgable individual, having knowledge about every demon specie and power that can assist him in evading attacks and getting away with his misdeeds.      

'''Regeneration:''' As a ghost demon, Misaya has the rare ability to regenerate any body part of his that has been lost, including his ghost arms. He was able to regrow his arm after Ashton had sliced it off and his leg when Damion had teared it off. Even though he can regrow his ghost arms back, they come back slightly weaker than it was before. His regeneration abilities are slightly faster than Ashton and Locaster's due to him being mixed with a ghost and is one of the only characters who can regenerate without overusing.        

'''Multi-lingual:''' Misaya has demonstrated that he can speak Burmese, Filipino, and English. This is seen when he says "Salamat po," a polite way of saying thank you in Filipino to Shay when he compliments his tavern, and speaks mostly Filipino, as Burmese is one of his more harder languages to speak.         

== Magic Abilities ==
'''Ghost Arms:''' Misaya has a multitude of light blue ghost arms that can extend endlessly without any stop. He is able to control and manipulate them to his extent. Being able to control his arms, they contain extreme strength that was nearly enough to crack all of Ashton's bones. His arms are ultimately much stronger than Damion, a Founding Demon and former Lieutenant Colonel. Misaya can also control the visibility of his arms, making them hidden so he can only see and hear them due to their ability to speak. Though, when he snaps his fingers, he is able to make his arms revealed to the people around him.   

'''Soul Transfer:''' Misaya has demonstrated that he can take the soul's of people without difficulty by putting his thumb onto someones forehead and taking away their soul's so they can become one of his arms. As he is able to take soul's, it will add onto his lifespan. Misaya can also give life back by returning their souls to their original body, though he can only use this spell once every a thousand years and chooses to not use it.   

'''Ghost Form:''' Being part ghost, Misaya is able to transform into a ghost in order to remain invisible or to go inside of another being and control them, whether it'd be facial expressions, bodily movements or speech. With his ghost form, he becomes transparent and is able to fly through doors, windows and restraints, similar to [[Veena Lu|Veena's]] spirit form.   

== Weaknesses ==
'''Overuse:''' Like all demon's Misaya's main weak point is overusing his magic. His symptoms are a mix of both glitching and fatigue. He will start to glitch from his ghost form and his regular self, and his arms will start to become out of control, along with also becoming rather tired. If he overuses his magic to a certain extent, it will cause him to cough up alarming amounts of blood.   

'''Lavender:''' Misaya has demonstrated to have an extreme allergy towards lavender. When nearly possessing Locaster, he managed to consume Lavender in time in order to quickly shoo him away. As he is allergic, his reactions can range from typical allergy symptoms to his powers glitching.

'''Ferox Amata,''' otherwise known as '''King Ferox of Myria''', is a minor, yet frequently mentioned character in a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. Even though he has not made an appearance, he has been revealed to be the king of the kingdom, Myria, who the kingdom across from them, Leiden, had disdain for.  

Ferox is one of the main participants in the Leiden-Myria war, attempting to capture the shadow demon and spirit hybrid in order to get the rest of the land for his people that have countlessly suffered at the hands of the kingdom of Leiden.  

== History ==
Little is known about Ferox's early life, as he has never made an appearance in the roleplay, though he has been frequently mentioned by many of the characters throughout the series. Though, he was raised in a small kingdom as a child before his parents had mysteriously died. Ferox has blood of the Amata clan and discovered Myria after Leiden was created.  

Ferox is the king of the forest-like kingdom, Myria. Though it was not as vigorous as it's neighboring kingdom, Leiden, the people were happy and was described as being a determined and optimistic king, unlike the rather scornful and hostile king of Leiden, Acacius. It has been stated that both Ferox and Helios used to be rather close acquaintances when they were younger, but had fallen out due to their views on the world and their opinion on freedom, where Ferox had a mindset that everyone should be treated equally, the king of Leiden only wanted the people to be his subjects and does not see them as equal. This had caused a rift in their friendship and they slowly started to become rivals with one another. Even though the two became rivals, Ferox showed respect and never said anything foul-mouthed or disrespectful to the king, as he wanted to get back where they were before.     

When ruling Myria, Ferox gave more freedom and reasonable codes, but laws that would ensure no crime as they got to enjoy the freedom they had. He was described as a great ruler because of his leadership skills, and due to that, Myria was a peaceful kingdom with rather low crime rates, abundant in resources with people having enough to support their children and families and was described to be a kingdom that did not get into much conflict. In Leiden, however, it was much different than Ferox had hoped for: He had noticed  there was high poverty and extremely high crime rates with an alarming death count, despite being so extravagant on the outside with a rather high development scale in richer areas.       

As a result, many citizens of Leiden had managed to gain citizenship in Myria in order to live in peace, despite it being in a more developing stage and less wealthier than Leiden. Though, Acacius, the king of Leiden, had started to steal supplies from Myria that were being exported from both Elveria and Misterin. Ferox had confronted Acacius on the matter, but he dismissed the matter, saying it was delayed due to weather. Ferox found it suspicious, as the weather was said to be warm for most of the day         

== Appearance ==
Ferox is a tall man around the age of thirty-three with a slightly muscular build with brown skin and messy, black hair that goes towards his back. His eye's are shown to be two different colors, one being a dark gray tone and one being white with one of his hands having a black claw to replace one of his arms that he had lost. On the left eye, he has a long scar that goes across his face, and on the sides of his head are two, black horns that curl down to his ears.

Ferox's attire consists of a gray bodysuit shirt that has darker sleeves with two, dark gray armor-like padding on the wrist area with a cross necklace hanging down from his neck. Around his chest is light silver chest armor with white rimming and a dark gray belt with silver lining that goes around his hip area. Ferox also dons white, slightly baggy pants with a gray cloak that slings on his shoulders and black boots with dark gray patterns.  
== Personality ==
Even though Ferox was not seen throughout the roleplay, by many accounts of Myrian citizens, he is described to be a rather kind and gentle soul while having a strong sense of justice for those around him with a small distaste towards king Helios due to the treatment of his own people and his kingdom. According to Locaster, he has been described in some writing as being a good leader, always trying to fight for what is right with a rather positive view on the people around him and the world and seemed to have a similar personality to [[Damion Halloreen|Locaster's father]] during the time of him being a founding demon, wanting the better for his people and did not want them to suffer, doing everything he could to make his people live happily without conflict.      

Despite being enemies with the king of Leiden, Ferox has demonstrated to be a very respectful individual. Even though Helios has a distaste for Ferox and his kingdom after the both of them became rivals, he tries his best to never say anything that can come off as disrespectful to him, let alone disheartening or rude to him as he demonstrates that he has a desire to reconcile with king Helios to assist in helping his kingdoms. He shows an equal amount of respect for any individual around him, whether it'd be a merchant or one of nobility, and treats people with dignity and compassion.        

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilites:''' Though, not much are said about Ferox's abilities, according to many, he had demonstrated to be not only a powerful individual, but was one of the best fighters due to being experienced in combat because of his father being a general in the army for Misterin.

'''Áine Ashe''' (Irish pronunciation [ˈaːnʲə] "Awn-ye") is a minor character of a Good vs Evil Roleplay. He is a vision demon and selkie hybrid that wanders the North Desolates of Azuren.  

A mute soul, he communicates through sign language after his voice was taken away by macha's owls, and due to this he cannot make loud noises, such as screaming, and commonly has to use a bell in order to make loud noises.   

== History ==
Little about Áine's past is known, as he usually does not interact with many of the characters. Though, what is known about him is that he was born to a selkie mother and a vision demon father, though his mother had left after being consumed by the sea when giving birth to him, and his father had to go out at sea to retrieve him from going with his mother in the ocean by going in the deep end and swimming down so he does not lose him as well. After retrieving him, he  became depressed and started drinking while attempting to take care of his child, but after a few years, he perceived his son as an evil being for taking his wife away from him.  

Due to his mothers absence, his father began to grow a hatred for Áine. He would neglect him at first when he was a child, not showing him the attention and affection that he wanted. Being deprived of affection, Áine only had a lyre that his mother was preparing to give him as a birthday gift, and with this he had developed a passion for music, often isolating himself in order to cope with his loneliness that he could not resolve on his own.  

as Áine grew older, his father began to act out by starting to abuse him verbally and physically because of his internal hatred for him due to him resembling his late mother much more than his father had expected him to. Because of the constant abuse at his home, Áine had attempted to keep distance from his father in order to not hear him screaming in his face. Unfortunately, the attempt had failed and he began to get dragged out of his room so his father could take his anger out on him because of his appearance reminding him of his mother.    

Even though Áine's father did not abuse his mother, most of his hatred turned to his son due to seeing him as the sole cause of his mother's disappearance when he was born. According to Áine, his father would at times attempt to kill him via strangulation, but he could not bring himself to do so because he would have a perception flip that would make it seem like he was strangling his wife when he was not, ultimately making Áine fear his father.       

After being abused for many years, Áine grew up mostly with no one to love him, not having a proper relationship with his father and often isolated himself by hiding under his bed or simply hurdling himself in the corner of the bathroom. He sometimes stayed outside to play his lyre, which created small, white sparks that appeared when playing his lyre float around him. However, when he was a teen, the tunes he made with his lyre had started to attract mysterious owls, often singing to the tune Áine would play. Seeing this, he found joy in playing music and              

== Appearance ==
''(NOTE: this character has two appearances: one Animal Jam model, and one Gacha Club Model. The Gacha Club Model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam Models and Gacha Club Models are used to show them both In animal jam and as an actual person.)''

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Áine is a tall man with a skinny build, standing roughly at 6'1 with long, white-beige hair that extends to his ankles and tied into a braid. He has ghostly pale skin with two colored eyes, one a baby blue shade and one white. At times, he is mistaken for a woman because of his facial features. 

Áine's attire consists of his selkie coat, which is pure white and extends down to his ankles. Around his neck are gray scarves layered on one another with white detailing. Under his selkie coat and scarves is a long dress that covers most of his body with white socks and black shoes.  

In his coat pockets, he carries multiple anesthetic needles that have the ability to knock someone unconscious without having to fight them. He often carries a white lyre, similar to Saorise's shell from the 2014 film, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Sea_(2014_film) Song of the Sea]''.    
=== Animal Jam Model ===
Áine's Animal Jam Model is a fox with a white outer-fur and beige underbelly with light blue eyes. On his body are light blue swirly patterns that cover most of his body. On his head is a white flower crown that is supposed to resemble his hood, his body being covered with a white cloak with a ghostly spiked collar around his neck. On his paws are a pair of gloves, and on his tail is armor that extends nearly to the tip. 
== Personality ==
When introduced, Áine demonstrates to be a quiet, yet very intellectual and gentle soul who has a small passion for music. He commonly plays his lyre whenever he is alone, but has a hard time opening up to others because of him not having a voice, often keeping to himself and keeps contact with those around him as minimal as possible and often resorts to running away when someone does a rather threatening gesture with their hands or body language.  

Due to his mutism, Áine mostly has to mouth his words or sign them with his hands, much to his annoyance and has a very strong desire to get his voice back. Even though he does not talk, he remains as polite and form as possible to not give a bad impression of himself to others through his facial expressions. He mostly uses body language and sign language to assist him in trying to get the words out.   

Despite being silent, he has demonstrated to be rather obstinate at times, making various rude hand gestures for those to leave him alone and refuses any help from those around him, and when annoyed, he often resorts to using one of his anesthetic needles so he would not have to deal with anyone's antics. Áine expresses his dislike for being mute, often yearning to receive his voice back.    

Áine has been described as having a rather charming beauty to him, as those who see him cannot resist to stare at him, and sometimes he could get mistaken as a woman because of his more feminine facial features. He uses his features to an advantage by getting the upper hand in many situations. With his looks, he is also a very intelligent man, using deception to trick others for falling for him.    

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' Being both a demon and a selkie, Áine is both very powerful, yet very dangerous at the same time. Even though he appears relatively harmless on the surface, his abilities as both a vision demon and selkie combined can be seen as deadly due to having an alluring appearance of a seal, but the powers of one of the rarest demons. With both his looks and abilities, he uses both of them to take advantage of any situation, whether it'd be a fight or a simple encounter with another person.        

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Áine, like all demons, possesses a superhuman-like speed, but is hindered when underwater. He has been able to out-pace many bounty hunters and soldiers in the past by using his wits and speed

After the giant fight at the Jamaa palace, the town is overrun with jammers and foreign visitors, plus Jack is badly hurt. Junior will need a certain gray heron’s help.  Plus, Dash finally has an army to aid Zios. Oh Mira, what else could go wrong these days?

== Entering the Darkness ==
Junior struggled to drag Jack through the bushs and ferns. The young unconscious wolf needed help and fast. 

“JACK! Wake up!” Junior muttered through matted fur. The youngling remained unconscious. Oh Mira, may she have mercy. Junior trudged through the ferns, getting seeds and prickles stuck to his fur, Jack’s metallic leg scrapping against rocks and creating such an ugly noise. It hurt Junior’s ears. 

That’s when his hind leg slipped into wetness. He raised his paw, shaking the water that his fur had carried from the small encounter. 

“We’re here.” 

He pushed Jack into the river, his unconscious body heavy. The young wolf slipped easily among the riverbank and into the river. Junior hopped in after. 

Gosh, the experience was nauseating. How did he do this almost every day when he was younger? Slipping through darkness, that buzzing noise that never stopped, ugh. Finally, he flipped his body so his paws faced the direction he thought was down and he landed roughly into a black room, the floor shining as if made of crystal. Mira’s imprisonment area. Jack layed on the floor. Grabbing him again, Junior pulled him across the floor to a cage-like structure. 

Tears stained the floor, Junior seeing the salty tears falling down from the familiar gray heron’s beak. “Mira,” He murmured. 

“Junior?” She raised her head, standing upright. Her figure was tall compared to Junior, her stature beating him by a few feet. 

“Mira,” He bowed his head, lowering his ears. After a bit, he raised again, speaking, “Mira, I need your help. Jack, he… she…” He stammered a bit, panicking slightly. “The Phantom Queen. She used his body and he’s badly hurt.”

“Bring him to me,” So Junior did. He lifted the pup by his scruff and pulled him closer to Mira. Laying a wing on him, her brow furrowed. “She’s infected him with her magic.”

“Is-Is there anyway to help him?”

“The Lava Crystal. So powerful, it’ll melt away her magic.” Mira straightened. 

“The last time I saw it… it was in the Jamaa palace. I’m too badly hurt, I can’t get through a single hall without that idiot, Max, jumping me.” Junior growled under his breath.

“Then let me help you too. You’re a descendant of Void, plus one of my chosen ones. I can spare some magic on a regular wound.” She leaned forward. 

Junior flinched back, his ears pressed up against his head. “No!” He shook his head. “I mean- no. You’re too weak. You’re barely surviving down here and we still haven’t found a way to get you out! Not like we can anyways now that Zios’ dead and we don’t have his power. Plus… you’re all I have. Dad- Greely is who knnows where. My mom is gone too. Silver and Smudge…” He growled, digging his claws into the hard floor, leaving scratch marks. “Dash killed them. And Dare and DJ are on his side!” He barked. “And now Jack! And Flora’s dead too!”

“Calm Junior.” Mira breathed. “I have enough of my magic to spare. And I have an idea on how to free myself. But we need Jack for it. And for that, we need to crystal. As for us getting it, you need to get better. Come closer.” 

Junior caved and took a step forward. He was engulfed in darkness suddenly, letting out a yelp as he saw a bright light. Light blue. Curiosity got the best of him and he approached. His nose touching it ever so slightly. 

Frick. 

He jerked, opening his eyes in surprise. Standing over Jack’s mauled body. He let out a scream before, “Junior! Wake up!” 

Mira’s voice awoke him. Ugh, back where he was. And something felt off. Good. But off. He turned to see his wound on his side way better now. Looking just like brand new too. Nice! What wasn’t nice was the giant pair of wings he now donned, blue feathers like Mira. “B-WHAT?! Mira!” He whipped his head around to face her. “I thought you were giving me enough to heal! Not to have your powers!?”

“Yes, but you’ll need them. I can feel it.” She winced, weak.

“Feel it?! You can’t feel the future!” He frowned, his tail drooping and his new wings folding down, touching the floor beside him, too heavy for him to control just yet despite his strength from being with the phantoms.

== LORE ==
'''&lt;u&gt;Author's Note:&lt;/u&gt;'''  ''Before you read the story, you need to know the lore or else literally none of it will make any sense. The story is based off Animal Jam lore with a twist.'' 

Jamaa was created by two entities, a God and a Goddess named Mira and Zios. They married, and had one child. Helios. Helios was a highly disobedient child with a record of causing drama in Jamaa, including scamming, bullying, and other offenses. His influence influenced Jammers' poor behaviors to this day, and he is nicknamed the God of Destruction. Helios didn't have any magic, yet. He wouldn't have any magic until he turned 13 and he knew this, and was very angry and jealous. He did whatever he could to make his mother cry and beg for him to stop, just so he would seem more powerful. Mira's tears created a harmful entity: Phantoms. Phantoms fed off of chaos and negative emotions, making them stronger. Zios did whatever he could to protect his wife and ward off these phantoms from harming other jammers and Mira, but couldn't prevail. Mira passed away from heartbreak due to Helios' actions, and Zios became infuriated. He summoned a group of the strongest and most loyal jammers he knew, today known as the Alphas to take down the Phantoms. Zios used what was left of his magic to create a realm for the Phantoms to be kept away in, and the Alphas did the remainder of the work of expelling the phantoms. Helios admired the phantoms, and was angry at his father for expelling them. He challenged his father to a fight, and due to Zios' weakness, he died in the fight as well. The alphas expelled Helios to the Phantom Realm, not knowing what to do with him, because they didn't want him in Jamaa. Helios, hurt by his father's actions, allowed himself to be taken over by sadness, and he too became a Phantom. 

Helios' story didn't end there. He turned 13, and suddenly, he had magic. He was already insane enough, and with this magic, he convinced the proclaimed king of the Phantoms to adopt him. He became the Phantom Prince, but with a heavy desire to become king, he soughts out a wife so he can succeed his "new father". Time significantly slows down in the Phantom Realm, so it may have been maybe 2 years in Jamaa (he was exiled to the Phantom Realm at age 11) however, in the Phantom Realm, it was about 6 years, and you do not age normally, but you age physically in the Phantom Realm as if you are in Jamaa, making Helios 17-years-old chronologically, however he was physically and nearly mentally of age. the phantom realm kinda defies the laws of nature

== &lt;u&gt;'''PROLOGUE'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

==== '''&lt;u&gt;Helios' POV&lt;/u&gt;''' ====
If you walked a moment in my shoes, for any time in my life, you'd immediately either love it or hate it. As for me, I love it. I worship it. This is me, and I'm never changing. At least, that's what my mother and father wanted me to do. However, that doesn't matter. They're long gone, and I should've been the one to succeed them, if it weren't for my actions. Do I regret them? Not at all. I'm Helios, prince of a much greater realm now, and my time to shine is coming so soon, the idiots on the other side won't even see it coming. 

I hear a rustling coming from the hallway, and I turn around to anticipate who is coming, likely a servant, a guard with updates.. or.

The door swings open, and a raven haired man of great height with dark black skin of a pure Phantom enters the room.  My father. 

I've committed my time to becoming someone that would make my father proud. I made all the plans. I did this.  

"Son, It's time for you to make me proud. the guard told me to tell you he's almost ready, for, you know.."

My eyebrows raise, a grin rises from my lips. "Well done, tell him I'm ready to give the all-clear whenever he's ready."

This could be the end of everything, but I'm ready to sacrifice it all. This was my one goal in life, and I will succeed. That's a promise. To my father and my slaves. And my future slaves.

Things are about to get interesting.

== '''&lt;u&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;/u&gt;''' ==

==== '''&lt;u&gt;MIRA'S POV&lt;/u&gt;''' ====
"Fawn, let me cut your fur! It's getting so freaking long!"

"Last time you did it you shaved me bald!"

"It was for a good reason!"

Yes, daily arguments with my 10-year-old brother, Fawn. At least Daisy was more cooperative. But there really wasn't much of a reason to cut her fur, she was very well groomed and didn't need it. I probably should've told Fawn to quit yelling so loud, or the neighbors in the den next door would come and "check" on us. Too late. I hear a knocking on the den door. Then a grouchy woman's voice.

"You kids better keep it down! Where are your parents?!"

Ugh, the old neighbors next door. The ones who live in the old burrow next to us instead of a den. I put down the scissors. "This is your own damn fault," I growl to Fawn, who sticks his tongue out at me. I walk to the door and open it, seeing my two neighbors, the two old ladies who were always up in our business. I begin to answer her question without haste.

"I've told you a million times, our parents work all day and come home late at night when you old bags are sleeping! Now leave us alone, I'm busy." I tell them, highly impatient. They usually come back. They're too old to suspect anything wrong. Except what I'm telling them is a big ass lie that I can't tell anyone or else we're all screwed.

The reality is, our parents went missing 3 years ago without a trace. I knew not to report them missing, or else my siblings and myself would be dragged away and put into the Bunny Burrow Orphanage. Speaking of Bunny Burrow, Bunny Burrow: A leisurely suburb where the population is 100% bunnies. Resting just in between Jamaa Township and Sarepia Forest, It's basically the best place to be. For bunnies anyways. There's a lot of old folk in Bunny Burrow, like my annoying neighbors.

Speaking of them, I'm snapped out of my daydream when one of them grouches at me again. "Well, keep quiet! Or I'll report you to the town government for being a danger to our ears!" 

"If you report us, I'll report you for harrasssment. Hmph!" I shut the door. I turn around, Fawn is standing behind me. "You freaking idiot! You see what would've happened if they realized we live alone?" I hiss quietly, just above a whisper, to Fawn. Fawn looked unphased. "Well, it's not my problem," he says. "Don't cut my hair."

"You'll regret this someday if we all get separated!"

"Maybe that's better because you're so grumpy," He retorts.

I decide not to fight with him any longer. I walk to the kitchen, noticing we're out of carrots. Crap, we run out of these all the time, and it's near end of Harvest Season so they'll be more expensive. I walk to our money jar and take out enough gems to pay for a medium bundle of carrots, grab my coat, and begin walking toward the door, when someone grabs my sleeve. It's Daisy.

Daisy, with her innocent green eyes and long bunny ears. I wish she didn't have to live in the circumstances, but she's 8 years old and already understands. She looks up at me, her bug-eyes widened and sad. "Is it true we'll get taken away if we're bad and loud?" She asks me. I don't want to answer the question, but I do anyways. "Yes, Daisy. If the neighbors find out we live alone, we'll be separated. Which is why we have to be quiet, or loud enough for the neighbors to ''not'' hear us. Speaking of, tell Fawn that both of you need to go in your rooms and play and shut up until I get back from the market."

Daisy grins. "Okay! I'll tell him," and she hops off. I make my exit, walking towards the market.

== '''&lt;u&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/u&gt;''' ==
The 1 mile walk to Jamaa Township wasn't much for me. I was used to it, since we walked part of this path twice a week for school. School and I had a love-hate relationship, but I still went. I was always jealous of the children whose parents would kiss them goodbye and they'd happily hop off to school. Kids suspected things- but I told the usual lie of "they're always working". And they were too stupid to ask any other questions. Eighty percent of bunnies were too stupid or too caught up in their own business to worry. 

I arrive at Jamaa Township, Jammers of many animals, colors, shapes and outfits hurried around in different directions, most going home for the day because it was around 3PM. I pass the glorious Mira Bird Statue. 

Mira. The goddess of our life, the one who created Jamaa, the one who I was named after. Of course, I didn't have her long legs and her beautiful blue feathers or magic, but I have blue eyes, that counts, a little. I sometimes wish what it was like running a whole world before she died. I wish I could say a prayer to it, but I've got no time to waste, I don't like leaving my siblings home for too long.

I make it to the market, farmers restocking, calling out things like "Get your corn! Only 150 gems!" or other stuff like that. I walk to the one stall, the guy I always trusted with carrots, THAT Farmer. That farmer was an orange bunny with an orange beard who always had the tastiest carrots year-round. And he always sold them cheap to me.

He sees me and greets me. "Hey, Bird Girl!" Bird girl was his nickname for me, because of my name. "Hello, 3 bunches of carrots please!" I say in a usual cheery voice.

"300 gems," He says, pulling out 3 bunches of carrots, loading them into a bag. I pull the 300 gems out of my pocket and place them on the table, and he hands me the bundle of carrots. "Here ya go, Bird girl!" He says. "Goodbye!" I say, walking away from the stall and back on the path that lead to Bunny Burrow.

The mile-walk was a little harder with a somewhat heavy bag of carrots. It would be enough to feed us for about a week, give or take a few days depending on how hungry we are. I usually would hum a tune we learned in Music Class or something I heard on the Radio, like the music called ''"Jam On",''  my favorite song I've heard on the radio. 

As I get closer to the house, I begin to smell something, and the air grew heavier. This wasn't normal and I take this into account. I grow more suspicious, but what alarms me is a strange black substance trail as I get even closer to my house. The black substance amount grows as I turn the corner near our den. 

The first thing I notice when I finally see our den is that the door is open. I swear I locked it. Daisy and Fawn may be young and somewhat dumb, but even they don't open the door for anyone or leave the house when I'm gone.

The air is especially heavy, like fog, there is a highly suspicious green smog loitering by my house. There are large splashes of black goop on the front door and around my house. 

Something was very wrong.

== '''&lt;u&gt;CHAPTER III&lt;/u&gt;''' ==

==== &lt;u&gt;MIRA'S POV&lt;/u&gt; ====
I immediately put down the bag of carrots and run towards the door, running inside my house. I wasn't expecting what had happened inside.

It smells of death in my normally tidy and clean house. Foul, it nearly makes me gag. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, queasy and dizzy. That's when I see the mess. Dirt, black goop, broken plates and furniture. God, it would take weeks to clean this mess up. Did Daisy and Fawn get into a huge fight? How much noise did they make? What was this.. substance?

Where are Daisy and Fawn?

"FAWN! DAISY!" I scream, panicked, running through our den. I search their rooms. Daisy's first. That's when I see the blood. It's on the floor and on her bed. Her room is just as damaged, her toys sprawled everywhere- broken bed, plushies ripped in half, stuffing everywhere.. Black goop everywhere too. Panicked, I run into Fawn's room, his room is destroyed too, goop everywhere, and blood.

I scream at the blood, tears falling down my face. I run into the backyard in a last attempt, when I see Fawn's body laying in the grass, surrounded by a small pool of blood. I run up to him and roll him over.

"Fawn! Fawn! Speak to me, what happened?!" I cry out. He opens his eyes, groaning in pain. I examine his body for wounds, he's got gashes on his arms and a large one on his forehead. They're bleeding heavily- but not bleeding red. Purple instead. "Fawn, please tell me what happened!" I say to him.

He looks at me, dazed. "P-phantoms.. they.. they took Daisy.." His eyes roll in the back of his head and he falls unconscious in my arms.

Phantoms? They exist. Here? Impossible. I don't know whether to believe him, but I scoop him up and run back in the house, and out the front door. He's heavy, hard for 13-year-old me to carry. I begin screaming as soon as I get outside my den.

"HELP! HELP! SOMEONE HELP! MY BROTHER'S HURT!"

Jammers acknowledge my cries and begin coming out of their dens. Many confused, more horrified by the condition of our den and my brother. A bunny in a nurse's uniform, who I assume just came off her shift, runs up to us. "Put him down!" She commands me, and I obey. Anything to save him. The nurse begins quickly examining him, bringing out a medkit and taking out a stethoscope and listens to his heart. She looks at the nearest bunny she sees. "GO TO TOWN AND FIND HELP!" She yells.

I begin to panic. Please- please don't let my brother die. He's almost all I have left. I forget for a moment my sister's missing. But then I remember what Fawn said before he blacked out. Phantoms, they took my sister.

What if he's right?

What are they planning?

===== 2 HOURS LATER.. =====
The Jammer Paramedics and Police came quickly. They took Fawn away on a stretcher- and me to the police station. Before we left I saw many enter my house. Probably to investigate it. I now sit here on a chair, waiting for them to question me. A tiger woman comes out into the waiting area. "They're ready for you," she says. 

She directs me to a room, where two police officers sit. A blue rhino cop tells me to sit down, and I do. "Name?" he asks me.

"Mira Duskmoon," I say.

"Did you see anything? Hear anything?" He asks me.

"No! I came home and saw what happened. I left my 10 year old brother and 8 year old sister home for 45 minutes. My brother told me phantoms came and trashed the house, attacked them and took Daisy, my 8 year old sister!"

The rhino cop sighs. Like he doesn't believe me. "Look, kids make up stories all the time, he might just be covering for someone-"

"HE IS 10 YEARS OLD! HE ISN'T SMART ENOUGH TO DO THAT! No offense! Explain the freaking black goop then-"

There's a radio I should have acknowledged. And a TV. The radio begins crackling. "''Ladies and Gentlemen. This is a statement from the Alphas being released to you live. This is being broadcasted to all radios and TVs. If you are near a TV, turn it on immediately."''

The officer looks nervous, but he obeys, grabbing a TV remote and turning on the TV, which sits in a corner attached to the ceiling.

A red screen displaying '''EMERGENCY BROADCAST''' in bold white letters is what we see when we first turn this on. After around 8 seconds of this, the camera turns on, displaying 2 of the Alphas, Peck and Greely.

Peck's usually peppy voice sounds serious. "Jammers! This isn't a test or a drill. Reports from across Jamaa have been surfacing of alleged strange happenings! Over 40 jammers have been reported missing, and there have been 19 confirmed deaths. The thing is, we have no idea what's happening!"

Peck goes silent. Greely begins to speak in his usual gruff tone.  "We will do everything in our power to stop this. Jammers, do not try to play hero. Let the Alphas handle this, as we are the only ones who can stop this potential threat to our kind."

Peck continues. "Neighborhoods in Jamaa Township, Sarepia Forest, Appondale and Kimbara Outback have been placed on lockdown. Don't leave your homes for any reason. Jammer Police will be scouting the area. If you HAVE to leave, call the police and you will be escorted. This lockdown will last for 5 days. We will have the situation resolved by then! If you see something, say something! Stay tuned, Jammers!"

The screen goes black.

We all look at each other for a moment, the rhino cop's face is pale. So is mine, probably.

I was right.

''Oh, hell no.''

== CHAPTER IV ==
The Rhino Cop comes out of his trance, looking to me. 

"We're sorry, but we'll have to detain you for the time-being. You're a potential suspect and you were the only one at the scene of the crime," He explains, putting me in handcuffs.

"What?! Are you stupid? I told you, I was at the market! There's witnesses!" I yell, He shoves me forward and we start walking to the cells.

"Sorry, but unless you can name those witnesses, you're out of luck," He says, taking me to the cells and locking me in one of them.

As soon as he leaves, I sit on the bed and start thinking.

''Phantoms? But they're supposed to be in a different realm.. How'd they get here? Wait! But my brother and sister.. Fawn! I have to get him.''

I guess I'll have to devise a plan and get the hell out of here.

==== &lt;u&gt;PHANTOMS POV&lt;/u&gt; ====
"Another one?" He asks, tapping the table with his fingers. The tall individual comes out from the shadows, peering down at us.

"We just barged into a random house! We didn't know there would be too loudmouth kids alone in there! We just took the one who didn't fight back and killed the other one, we think," I say.

"Actually- He might be still alive-" My partner chimes in.

"WHAT?! WE HAVE A POTENTIAL WITNESS NOW, ARE YOU BOTH DUMB?!" He shouts, smacking my partner so hard he hits the wall and is left unconscious, leaving only me to deal with our aggressive master.

He looks to me. "Open that sack you got there," He commands me. I nod assent and open it, dumping the contents. One little girl, slightly bruised up, whimpering and curled in a ball. He grabs her by her ears and pulls her up to his level. He's tall. She's maybe half his size. She yells in fear and anger and starts kicking and screaming. He slaps her.

"If you cooperate with us and tell you everything you know about your inferior world, we'll let you go alive," He says, she doesn't look impressed. "What's your name?" He asks her, it's not a nice question. "Go to hell, you big damn poopyface butthead! STRANGER DANGER STRANGER DANGER STRANGER DANGER!! I wanna go home!!" She protests. 

"Swearing is bad, kid," He says, going to his desk, opening a drawer and taking out a metal rod, he slaps the rod and it turns on, shooting out lightning bolts. H''oly hell, he's gonna torture a little kid for information? Ruthless he is, but I didn't think he'd go this far!''

He holds the electric metal rod to show her. "I said. Cooperate. I won't ask twice. If you don't cooperate, we kill everyone you love and then kill you. Understand?"

The little girl gulps. She's in quite a lot of trouble, and it isn't because she was being too loud in the house.

''&lt;u&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;''  ''so it's been like 2 months since i updated this story- i forgot most of the plot but yeah i'll try to finish the book but if i lose motivation or forget about it again i'll discontinue it''

== CHAPTER V ==

==== &lt;u&gt;MIRA'S POV&lt;/u&gt; ====
It has been almost a day since anyone came to check on me. I thought maybe it was because they were patrolling the areas. Or they'd just forgotten about me. I don't know. By the time some random cheetah officer came to check on me, I was thirsty, and starving.

I wave her over. "Hey! I was detained for no reason like, a day ago, and nobody has given me food or water for that entire time! Can you either give me food, or let me out? I haven't done hella anything!" I say, as she looks at me. "You look like a kid.. how old are you?"

"13," I respond. She takes out her keys from her pockets. "They have no business locking up kids in here," she mumbles. unlocking the cage. "Go home, I'll escort you, it's too dangerous."

I agree. But little does she know, I've got a plan. I need to get Fawn out of the hospital and get the hell out of Jamaa Township and into the Canyons, where Phantoms avoid due to the altitude. If this is actually phantom stuff. 

We walk outside and as soon as we divert paths, crossing into the town square of Jamaa Township, I turn around and bolt the opposite direction toward the hospital. "Hey!" She shouts, chasing after me. I might be a fast bunny with long legs and youth on my side, but she's a cheetah, and she's much faster, and she catches me within a minute.

She pins me down, hissing in my ear. "Do you want me to lock you up again? Why don't you just behave and I won't have to hurt you?" I notice, she only has one of my arms pinned. I ball my right hand into a fist and punch her as hard as I can. She falls off of me and I get up and run into the wooded area between Kimbara Outback and Jamaa Township. I hear her yelling, but I don't really care. 

On my way, I see occasional individual cops, but almost all of them were in small groups, but I managed to avoid them. They probably would've knocked me unconscious and taken me away, and I can't afford that. Not when my sister could be in danger, more likely dead. I shove that thought in my head, but to be honest, she's more likely dead if she was really taken by phantoms. 

''But why did they only take her and not Fawn? Why didn't they kill Fawn? What are their motives..'' Are some of the many thoughts running in my head as I make my way. 

The walk takes nearly 3 hours of my time, if you include avoiding police officers and distance. By then I get there, it is sunset. The police officer patrols seem to be ramping up in the main places, but there aren't as many in Kimbara due to the fact there's really only one building (the hospital) and how isolated it is. There's still officers, but they're avoidable. 

When I arrive, I slip behind a bush until the police officers move away a bit, then I approach the door. Surprisingly, it's unlocked, and I quickly slip inside the hospital. There, I'm greeted by nobody, so I start walking down the main hallway that had rooms in it, peering into every room, usually finding sleeping patients. In the final room I check, There's someone sitting up.

It's Fawn!

I quietly run inside, whispering loudly. "Fawn! I was so worried! I thought you'd died!" I walk up to his bed.

Fawn embraces me. "Mira! I was so worried about you! I'm so scared for Daisy.."

I nod, before whispering: "Fawn, are you telling the truth? You can't be telling jammers that you saw phantoms unless it's true!"

Fawn looks at me. "But sis, you need to believe me! Cross my heart, hope to die! Phantoms came and took Daisy and hurt me!"

I begin to put two pieces in my mind together.. ''But the alphas.. they said that it was "unknown happenings". Are the Alphas hiding something? Why are they lying to us?''

Suddenly, I hear a male voice behind me. "Tsk, Tsk, You know little girls shouldn't be walking about during lockdown," it says.

I turn around to see a male arctic wolf in a lab coat, tall, with glasses, like a stereotypical scientist.

''Uh oh.''

== CHAPTER VI ==
"Who the hell are you?!" I say, getting ready to defend my brother.

Without a peep, the scientist shoves me over, and I fall to the floor beside the bed my brother sat on. The scientist pulls a needle out of his pocket and injects Fawn with it. Fawn's eyes widen, he suddenly blacks out. I yell in anger and swing at him. "Don't you freaking touch my brother, you old sicko!"

He seems to be unfazed by my outburst. He kicks me off of him, and I lay on the floor from the powerful kick. I'm short and scrawny and he is much taller than me, I can't fight him unless I have a weapon, which I do not. He looks down at me. "Oh, dear, you don't understand. I'm protecting you from your brother. You don't understand."

"Understand what?!" I say. "You injected him with some mystery solution and he's unconscious. Why are you doing this?"

The scientist frowns. "Let me show you," He lifts the blanket off of Fawn, grabbing his arm and unwrapping the bandage. I get up and stand beside him, when I notice what the scientist is talking about. The wound... it's a sickly purple. oozing.. blood? Goop? I can't tell. It makes me want to vomit, and I do gag. "What.. what happened?"

He wraps the bandage back up. "You see, this isn't a normal wound. The phantoms did this. I've studied phantom behavior for years. You see, we have.. phantom experiments in our lab. These phantoms attempt to infect jammers by scratching them and injecting a toxin into them, which turns them into a phantom."

I can't believe what I'm hearing. "No.. you're a liar, no.. My brother can't turn to a phantom.. He's 10!"

"I'm sorry you have to hear this. The good news is, I took a sample of his blood and he lacks the toxin, meaning he likely won't turn into a ''full'' phantom. More of a Hybrid, he'll be human, but have phantom attributes and possibly behaviors. He may have physical phantom characteristics, too."

I shake my head. "No, he's too innocent for this.."

"He cannot live in normal society, unfortunately. He could be kidnapped, killed, and more. I will take him to my lab and he will become a sub-"

From shock, I basically see red. His words anger me even more. "NO. You will not take him!" I impulsively say, shoving the man. "He's MY brother, I decide what to do with him! And-" 

He shoves me back, pulling out another needle and lunging at me with it. The needle stabs into my leg, and I forcefully pull it out, painfully, and throw it. I kick him in the face and grab a glass beaker that was sitting on the nightstand next to Fawn's bed, slamming it into his head. The scientist falls unconscious, laying on the floor.

I get up, going to my sleeping brother. I'm starting to feel dizzy, and it hits me that I was stuck with the needle. I knew, I had to get out of here, and fast. I unhook the IV drip and the monitors from him, and pick him up, carrying him bridal style out of the room, down the hallway and to the main lobby, when a nurse sees me. "Hey, stop!" She yells.

I break into a run, busting through the door and running outside. The nurse follows me, yelling "Escapee!" I turn my head around as I run, my brother in my arms, noticing two officers have acknowledged the nurse and are now chasing after us. I begin running toward the lost temple of Zios.  As I'm running, I hear my brother's voice. "Mira?" He asks. "Shh," I say, continuing to run. 

I begin to get dizzier, and I know the medicine is taking effect. Even though only a little has entered my system, it's strong enough to slowly knock me out, but I persistently keep running until we reach Zios.

I hear the loud voices of the officers, and things begin to blur. I hear a third loud voice, and I'm too dizzy to keep moving forward. I put Fawn down and suddenly everything goes black.

== CHAPTER VII ==
A crackling noise is what awakens me. As I come to, I can feel something decently soft underneath me. As I regain energy, I can identify the crackling as one of a fire now, and I begin to stir. I'm nearly fully awake now, and I can make out 2 voices. One that I know is my brother, and.. someone else. My brother, talking to someone else besides me?

My mind begins to think. Overthink, too. ''Where are we?! Is my brother hurt? He's talking to a bad person!'' I sit up and glare ahead, seeing Fawn, and a boy. This boy, a wolf, sitting next to my brother, looks at me. He appears to look only a little older than me.

"Who are you?" I say, staring at him. "And where have you taken us?"

Fawn pipes in. "Relax, Mira! This guy is the one who saved us from the officers! I woke up and found you sleeping so he carried you here. They're gone now!"

"You didn't answer my question."

The boy pipes in. "Sorry, an introduction seems to fit here, I'm Boreal Vinewind. I've been living alone for about a year now, camping, and such. I felt bad when I saw you two. Seems like you were in a pretty tough situation."

"He already knows your name and mine! I think we can trust him. You were asleep a lot longer than I was,. that's super weird! You must've been REALLY tired!" Fawn says.

"So, Mira, tell me, what happened?" Boreal says, looking to me.

"Well, our home got attacked, my sister is missing, my brother got hurt. Phantoms did it, he was hospitalized, I came back to free him and-" I cut myself off. Fawn, he's too young to know what he could and will eventually be capable of. "Actually, can we talk in private?"

"How come you two get to talk in private?! That's not fair!" Fawn protests. "You will listen to me! Now, go into that tent," I tell Fawn, and he hesitantly obeys.

I stand up, and I wobble a bit and nearly fall. Boreal suddenly gets up and catches me. "Woah there, whatever happened to you, you're not really ready to do too much stressful stuff for a bit," He says. He guides me to an area about 100 feet from his camp. "So, what did you want to tell me?"

"Before I tell you anything, you have to tell me about you," I say.

"Well.."

== CHAPTER VIII ==
Boreal seems to hesitate.

"My parents treated me right, and stuff. But they were really controlling. I wasn't allowed to just be a boy. I wanted to be free and do stuff, and I could never. I guess that's where my parents went wrong. Suddenly my parents decided to get fancy secret jobs and I knew they gatekept a lot of stuff from me, and they started to lie to me a lot. In plain sight, too. I decided to leave them at 14, about a year ago and live on my own. They never looked for me."

"So you're 15 now? Do you ever miss your parents?" I ask.

"Yes to the first question, no to the second,," He responds. "If they never looked for me, why? Did they ever love me? And how old are you?"

"I'm 13, and I'll be 14 soon. Fawn is 10," I respond.

I don't know what else to say. I felt bad for him, that's all. It's hard losing your parents. I know all too well how it feels. I'm glad one of my siblings doesn't remember and the other barely does. I look into his eyes and put a hand on his shoulder.

"Listen, they likely love you very much and miss you.. Putting their job first was a dumbass move, but love for a child never ends. They're somewhere, somewhere out there, possibly hoping their son comes back to them."

Boreal seems slightly assured. "You'd make a good therapist someday," He says. I notice he's still holding onto me. "Um.. you can let me go now," I say awkwardly, and he does.

He smiles. "So, tell me about you, why are you and Fawn out here? Where are ''your'' parents?"

"Missing. 3 years ago, zero trace. Nobody knows what happened to them. Basically, I left Fawn, and my sister, home alone. I came home and they'd been attacked. My sister is missing. Fawn was hurt, and someone took him to the hospital. I was detained under suspicion of having something to do with it. The Alphas came on TV and said something mysterious was going on. Fawn claimed it was phantoms, and I kind of believe him-"

"Wait- the ALPHAS have something to do with this, you're saying?"

"Yes. They might be trying to cover this up. For good or for bad reasons. I don't know. A scientist confirmed my theory- he sedated my brother, tried to sedate me, some of the medicine must've gotten into me but hadn't worked right away. I knocked him out but he could be sending out jammers to look for us-"

"Wait wait wait- you're WANTED?" Boreal says. "Gosh damn!" 

"Basically, which is why Fawn and I cannot stay for long. We have to get to the bottom of this, find my sister and possibly find out why the Alphas are covering this up, if we have time."

Boreal looks at me, intrigued. "You know what? I want to help you,"

I'm kinda shocked at this statement. "Really?" I say.

"Yes, let's figure this thing out, together."

''&lt;u&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: (4/4/2023)&lt;/u&gt;  damn i wrote 3 chapters in one night (it's 3:20 am rn) and i wrote all three in about an hour and a half. i decided not to discontinue the story bc i'm kind of invested now, i've also decided there will be a book 2. i already have a plan for it, and i plan to finish this first book in the coming months and have book 2 started by summer. i've got the concepts for the rest of book 1 and part of book 2 written so woohoo yay me for being productive''

== CHAPTER IX ==
''&lt;u&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: (5/25/2023)&lt;/u&gt; I completely forgot about the story again and abandoned it for another month and a half LMAO but without further ado let me at least try to finish another chapter before i forget about it for another month''

''&lt;u&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE #2: (6/9/2023)&lt;/u&gt; LMFAO I forgot about this again but let me at least do this chapter but I have no motivation to actually finish this book because nobody goes on this wiki anymore''

"Together," I echo.

"Together" is a word that doesn't compute to me, since I have been left alone for so long. I'm scared I'll get abandoned again, worse, killed, betrayed by this individual. I find it hard to make sense that someone is willing to put their care into ensuring at least one of us gets out of a bad situation.

However, I find it quite comforting that someone is willing to do that for me.

Maybe this boy won't be so bad. "Deal," I say. We shake hands.

"So, what do we do now? We need to leave as soon as possible if we have any prayer of finding my sister alive. Time is money!"

"Don't worry, we'll figure things out. Just calm down. We'll sleep here tonight and then look for clues tomorrow," Boreal replies. 

We walk back to the tents, where Fawn is waiting. "Where were you guys?" He asks us.

"Umm. Talking about grown up stuff," I quickly reply.

Fawn snickers. "You forget you're still a kid, silly! Don't act like you're an adult," 

I give Fawn a smile. I can't let him realize the severity of the situation. Not yet. 

Boreal beckons me to the tents. "There's like four sleeping bags here. I used to have a few buddies with me. They left one day and never came back. I'm starting to wonder if there's connections to your sister and them."

I wonder as I grab a sleeping bag and place it next to where Fawn puts his. As we go to sleep for the night, I ponder to myself, my internal monologue and the crickets outside being the only things audible.

''Oh my god. What's happening? I'm so scared. I'm scared for both of us, all of us. What if the phantoms are hurting my sister? What if.. what if.. I don't understand. This is all too much. I'm overthinking, aren't I? Oh well, we'll get through this, I know it..'' 

''Oh, Daisy, I hope you're okay.''

Troubled sleep claims me moments later.

''&lt;u&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE #3 (6/9/2023):&lt;/u&gt; time to disappear again for another 1-2 months but oh well it's not like anyone's even reading this anyways, and if anyone is don't be surprised if i discontinue it lol''

== i won't say it out loud ==
Cressida ran a comb through her pixie-cut hair again. She was a sweating mess after a morning with her girlfriend, Aisumi. No, it wasn't anything dirty, she wasn't into that sort of stuff anyway, she'd just gone on her motorcycle in the summer sun for hours on what she thought was probably the hottest day in the season, and prayed to Kah'le she didn't get a sunburn. 

She lived with her older brother Zenith in a small house, with only four rooms- Hers and her sister Atlas, who currently was at a playdate, Zenith's, and her parents. She was adopted, like her sister, which was way she looked so different from the rest of her family, from skin to hair to powers. 

Zenith had dark magic. She had light magic. Light magic was the reason she cut her hair so short- she wanted to shave half of it off, but accidentally singed part of it. Screw being unique. 

Apart from motorcycles and being overall cool, Cressida played electric guitar. Her parents wanted to get her into violin, but she objected. Thankfully they were understanding of her. It was probably because they thought she was in her "Rebel Phase". She wasn't in a phase. She'd been like this ever since she was a little kid. 

She let herself fall onto her bed, sighing. There wasn't anything too interesting now that she wasn't with Aisumi.

Hello! I am tank force, You can call me ural, I will tell you my story of how i got a strange update on animal jam. So this happed 2 days ago.







[[File:Strange.error.png|thumb|476x476px|The issue with the game.]]
I saw some unnamed player using a pitch black monkey, It was probably the most "Tame" Of all things here. But as i went up, Oh boy did it get worst.

As graham got white eyes, It all looked not how it should be.

But it got more scary over time.

Okay, enjoy the better writing I guess.

== Chapter 1 - The Takeover ==
For centuries, the phantoms have failed, over and over again, to acquire the lush lands of Jamaa.

Of course, why would it ever happen? Us jammers have our ways, sometimes involving boomseeds. There’s also our renowned, acclaimed alphas there to defend us from any incoming phantom wave. We are safer than sound… right?

''Right?''

Swect and I have always not been more relaxed in the tranquil Sarepia Forest. Brimming with abundant greenery, thick verdant canopies, and the soft melody of crickets and other various insects, Sarepia is much more peaceful compared to the overcrowded, tumultuous mess they called Jamaa Township.

Well, Sarepia was. I’m not sure if any of Jamaa is peaceful anymore.

I wonder what happened to the alphas that day. Their absence during the incident. Where were they? Why were they even alphas if they weren’t even trying to save Jamaa that day?

Swect, my monkey friend, sat with me that day. We were relaxing near the campfire, discussing the usual–trading, the outrageous costs of clothing and furniture these days, and several other trivial matters. We did it pretty much every day. I suppose this is called a “normal day.” Pretty much the entirety of most jammers’ lives, including ours, can be summed up using those two words.

Today, however, was not a normal day.

It started when I detected a horrible stench. It was like Sarepia decided to take a bath in animal carcasses and rotting wood. Swect clearly noticed this as well, as I could tell from his face, which looked like he was about to release his insides.

“Damn… what is that sickly smell?” I could barely speak or breathe without taking in that foul effluvia. That was how terrible it was.

“I have no idea,” Swect mumbled, clapping his hands over his nose.

The other jammers nearby seemed to be nauseated by this smell too. One rabbit actually fainted, a brown  fuzzy ball limp on the ground. I felt as if I was about to faint too, despite being older and stronger.

Then came the fog. Thick and more purple than the alpha Peck’s pelt, it slowly accumulated around us, enveloping the entire forest. The campfire in front of us was the only reason Swect and I could still see each other, but the thickening fog continued to roll in, somehow diminishing the last of the flames. The peace.

Logic Wolf was sitting in &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt;his bed. He felt as he drew in breath and &lt;s&gt;elt&lt;/s&gt; let it out. He heard his heart beat more than what some Jammer countries would do when the &lt;s&gt;alpa&lt;/s&gt; alphas would come near.

The alphas were a bunch of jerks. 

They weren't there for him when he lost his wife, nor when a recent incident with some raccoon named Ryan and Bunneh demolished his house.

Zios, Bunneh got on his nerves. He &lt;s&gt;cound&lt;/s&gt; couldn't believe the stamina of the hare. The only thing they had in common was an enemy and the fact that they both had the most basic fur colors in Jamaa. 

He wanted a motivation to fight against Ryan, but wherever he looked, he found nothing.

He'd purchased a ticket to Balloosh, knowing fully well this wasn't a good measure against Ryan but hoping it'd at least buy him some time to get a passport to Fera (surely Ryan couldn't get one, right?)

That was when he heard the familiar drums.

He was socially obligated to step out of his house and bow, not that he liked it. People would look at you dirty if you didn't. 

So then he did.

He didn't get a good look at what was happening, but in the blink of an eye, an alpha had had an accident. A magical one. Tavie? He'd never met her. 

But he started to see things.

He blinked once, twice, and there she was.

His wife, lying next to him in his bed.

"Your paws are scratched up again, love," She said, as a memory played from so long ago.

"Well, that's what we factory workers go through. It's natural, really," He chuckled. He hadn't chuckled in weeks.

"Then I guess I'll need to buy you better gloves," She laughed.

"I love you, Sweetie."

"I love you too, Wolf."

A pause.

Wolf was sure there wasn't a pause there.

"But I need you to fight. Please. Remember what I used to do in college? Well... Taht wuz wahtt I deed! I fought against this crazed world. And I need you to continue what I did!" She pleaded.

"...Only for you. Sweetheart Arts."

His wife flinched when he uttered her full name.

Then, she was gone, and he was facing once again towards the dried up grass.

He ran. He ran like a roadrunner.

Then he saw them. Bunneh was fighting.

He had motivation now.

he HAD MOTUVIATON NAU!!!!!!!1!

Bunneh turned towards Wolf.

AND VULF DTURNED TOEARDS BUNNEH

AND SO DEY COMBINED INTO

VULFEH

AND WUIFLFEH WAS SO MCH MORE BUJFF THAN REIAN

'''Hideko Inazuma''' is a major character in a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. He is the illegitimate son of an upper rank official and the older brother of his adopted sister, [[Shizuka Ikami]]. He is a flesh demon that is a self trained mercenary who often acts more like a hitman than a mercenary.  

Hideko, at first, holds some hostility towards Locaster’s group after they had begun to show dislike towards his sister, who had both caused deliberate harm towards them and had also shown brutal hostility due to holding a grudge against them for insulting his sister after trying to tell him the truth.  

Though, throughout the roleplay, Hideko slowly started to warm up to his group and soon became apart of it in order to reunite the demon gems before the black vines take over Azuren and the rest of the world, and would often be a major support for them.  

== History ==
Hideko is the illegitimate son of an upper rank government official that governs the second sector of Lyakon, one of the second wealthiest divisions in the kingdom. His mother was an escort woman in the slums and had given birth to him out of wedlock. He was raised primarily by his mother until he witnessed his mother being murdered because of her species by three mercenaries, with her body parts were eventually sold off because of demons being a main target in the large black market trading network.   

His father had then took custody of him and raised him for two years before realizing he was a demon. His father then took him to Estelar and abandoned him when he was only five due to not wanting a child who was a demon after many of the other officials questioned him about Hideko being his legitimate son despite not being married.   

During his time in the slums, Hideko was a destitute child, lacking the resources to survive and was nearly impoverished because of the lack of jobs in Estelar and had little to no knowledge about the world around him. He would at times go days on end without any food or water, often resulting in him eating off his own skin due to being starved to near death and sometimes having to drink his own blood, or having to eat other parts of his body for the sake of his survival.   

Hideko's demonic features had never developed during this time period, and he often perceived himself as a human, meaning he would not be rejected or discriminated against. This had allowed him to be taken in many shelters, but most of the time he would be kicked out of them for not having the capability to steal goods due to his weak body and the lack of stealth he possesses.    

Constantly being transferred from shelter to shelter, Hideko slowly started to develop survival skills throughout time, and was taught about the concept of stealing from the capital, where the most enhanced thieves from the slums go at night and steal from there as they are known as the breadbasket for resources and supplies because of lack of funding in the third district, the area where most of the poorer cities lie under.     

Instead of wandering aimlessly, he started to observe each thief and started to copy their methods to sneak in the capital, usually practicing in forests behind the slums or near abandoned areas.  After only two months, Hideko became an advanced thief and started to steal with some of the other thieves without having to get kicked out or being stuck on the streets for too long. Later in his life, he eventually took in many of the children that were crammed together in an alleyway during the heat-wave season, beginning to raise them as their own and started to act more mature, despite only being twelve at the time.           

When raising the children, Hideko began to realize the purpose in his skills of thievery and started to steal for the sake of them, and begun to steal masses of supplies that were not easily accessed in the poorer areas. With his skills, he started to raise the children and did whatever he could to support them and give them a life not many children had in the slums. Eventually, he discovered an old house hidden in the woods and began to raise the children there, making sure they were fed and nurtured. He started to become more of a father figure to them more than just a caretaker and did everything he could to raise them as best as he could.                            

When asleep one night, he heard the sounds of a child crying and quickly went outside to find the source, to which he found his to-be younger sister, Shizuka, and took her in. During their first interactions, Hideko did not perceive Shizuka as his daughter, but considered her as his sibling due to the both of them being demons and also because of Hideko never meeting with a demon before. After taking her in and cleaning her up, Hideko started to tutor her in math, science, reading, literature, and combat in order to educate and allow her to defend herself. He treated Shizuka much differently than he did with the other children by acting more like a sibling to her and not a father figure.                                 

As Shizuka was being trained under his wing, she was taken on missions to steal with Hideko and both became a tag team duo. Shizuka used her telekinesis in order to stop the guards from attacking them and Hideko would make weapons from his flesh to knock the guards out cold, resulting in them bringing more supplies and resources. With her as an addition to his shelter, the children grew fond and curious of her because of her demon physiology and unique personality.

The Gacha Club model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam Models and Gacha Club Models are used to show them both In animal jam and as an actual person.)''  
===Gacha Club Model===
Hideko is a tall, slightly muscular man with long, brown hair in a ponytail that is similar to [[Ashton Khanh|Ashton's]] and yellow eyes. The front of his hair is rather disheveled and messy with one long strand of his hair being put in between his face. He, at times, can get confused as Ashton because of their similar hairstyle and facial shape.  
 
Hideko's attire is lighter in contrast to his younger sister [[Shizuka Ikami|Shizuka's]]: He is usually seen wearing a tan shirt with yellow and brown chest armor, being supported with a long, tan coat with the rimming being a cream yellow, and a brown hat with a navy blue brim that slightly hangs in front of his face, and around his waist is a sword with a brown sword-holder that holds up a pair of baggy, off brown pants with that are then sported by dark brown boots. 

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Hideko's Animal Jam Model consists of a brown arctic wolf with a brown outer fur and a beige inner fire, along with yellow eyes. His fur also is covered with light brown swirly patterns.  

Hideko's attire consists of a brown musketeer hat, brown spartan armor, a black long spiked collar around his neck, tail belts and huntress boots.  

== Personality ==
On the surface, Hideko is a hardened and rather stoic individual. He often acts rather harsh and brutally honest around [[Locaster Helios|Locaster]] and his group about the ways they had been talking about his sister and often tends to get hostile and aggressive around Soul Kawasaki, who attempts to tell him the truth about her but resulted in him using physical violence against Soul and demonstrates a distaste for him. Being a freelance mercenary, Hideko shows little to no emotion and often keeps a cold expression whenever around other people.        

Hideko is an incredibly brash individual and does things his own way without having to think of consequences due to his position as a freelance mercenary, breaking the law and taking justice into his own hands when needed. With his brash disposition, he is also perceived as both refined due to his polite mannerisms, but also having a way with his words whenever interacting with others, having the ability to charm others without difficulty. Because of his brashness, he often got into trouble with his boss due to him not being aware of the consequences in the end.         

Along with his brashness, Hideko has a soft spot for children; Having to raise over thirty of them in his sanctuary, he has demonstrated to be excellent around younger children and acts rather protective around them. According to Ashton, Hideko is like a baby sitter and used to watch other's children before becoming a freelance mercenary.         

Being abandoned by his father at a young age, Hideko has a habit of getting attached to others around him with a fear of those leaving him, sometimes projecting this onto his younger sister, Shizuka, and is very protective of her. He often has a desire to keep her safe after the incident where she was captured by the Black Sun when she was young, and can sometimes act overly protective of her because of his immense fear of losing the people he loves the most, including his acquaintances. He starts to express care and compassion for the other members of the group, specifically his sister, Ashton and Shay. He perceives himself as a bastard child because of being abandoned by his illegitimate father and is also facing extreme flashbacks from when his mother was murdered because of her specie.        

Despite being a flesh demon, Hideko has shown to hardly eat certain kinds of meat due to him having a problem with the texture and quality of it and is often teased for being a vegan, though he has shown to eat meat on the occasion because it is in his diet. He finds meat somewhat disgusting and often gets a disgusted feeling when attempting to eat it. Like Ashton, he has proven to be quite cynical and pessimistic, taunting Veena about the nickname "Vegetable," and repeatedly calling her that until she was annoyed in a playful manner. He also does this to other people like Locaster when he joking calls him "Longlaster," A nickname commonly used by Shizuka.          

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' As a freelance mercenary and formerly a thief that lived in the slums of Lyakon, Hideko proves to be a very powerful demon and combatant. His skills were exemplified in the group's battle against Crow, being one of the first flesh demons to craft a flesh gun and using it effortlessly and was able to go head on with Locaster during their time as being rivals. With his combat powers comes his intelligence, as it is exemplified during their battle with the dark entity where he was able to successfully ambush him before he could make a move, but it was only for a brief amount of time before he was thrown off of him. 

Against Akuji and the Lyakonian soldiers, his skill level starts to become on par with Akuji and went head on with him in a gun match and played a pivotal role in nearly defeating them before Cassian had ordered the soldiers to overwork them so they can get tired.

'''Immense Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Like all demons, Hideko has demonstrated to be incredibly fast, outrunning Shay during one of their many battles and is near the same speed level as Ashton. He was able to out-pace Crow without difficulty and knock him down to the ground without any trouble, and was also able to evade many of Akuji's attacks as he dodged many of his bullets with ease to an extent where he found it boring to keep up with him. 

'''Enhanced Smell:''' As a flesh demon, Hideko has a unique sense of smell, being able to detect the scent of mammals, demons and humans alike. With this ability, he can track down many individuals at the same time and can pick up scents from further ranges, such as mountains and highlands. His scent of smell is strong enough to pick up subtle movements and even eye twitches. 

'''Immense Durability:''' Hideko possesses a decently durable body, being able to uphold himself after being injured severely. He was able to withstand the bullet wounds that Lyakonian soldiers threw at him and managed to resist Locaster's attacks during their time as enemies. He was also able to withstand Akuji's punch to the stomach after he cursed at him for mistreating Ashton. He also exemplifies his durability after shielding Shizuka from an oncoming attack and taking in several bullet wounds.  

'''Regeneration:''' Hideko, like some of the demons, has the ability to regenerate any part of his body if he drinks blood from another person. He was able to drink some of Akuji's blood and regenerate his wrist that he shot off with his gun. He was also able to make a dent in Cassian's wrist so he could drink his blood in order to regain some of his arm that was nearly falling off. If he drinks too much of their blood, his abilities would increase significantly, as seen when drinking more blood from Akuji than expected and his strength increasing from it.    

'''Keen Intellect:''' Raising and educating himself, Hideko has proven to be exceptionally intelligent, being able to navigate the slums of Lyakon and having the capability of stealing without getting caught, with the occasional help of Shizuka. His intelligence is further proven by his knowledge in combat and the demon gems. He has also proven to be a good mathematician and was able to solve a difficult math equation effortlessly and managed to correctly predict the number of Lyakonian soldiers.    

'''Unlimited Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Hideko possesses superhuman-like stamina and endurance: He was able to keep standing after receiving a large bullet wound from a Lyakonian soldier and managed to withstand many of Akuji's attacks, despite his wound starting to act up and not having enough time to heal it.      

== Magic Abilities ==
'''Biokinesis:''' Hideko has demonstrated to possess powerful biokinesis, having the capability to manipulate his own flesh to any given extent. As he did not discover his abilities until later on in his life, he has proven to be slightly inexperienced in manipulating some of the flesh in his body.

'''Weapon Creation:''' Hideko has the ability to make flesh weapons by cutting a part of his wrist and manifesting a weapon out of his blood. This is seen when he makes a hammer out of his own blood effortlessly. He is advanced in this field to an extent where he was able to make a flesh double-barreled shot gun in order to shoot Crow in the head with to stop him from trying to kill [[Locaster Helios|Locaster]]. 

'''Wound Expansion &amp; Shrinkage:''' Hideko is not only able to manipulate his own flesh, but he is also able to manipulate others flesh by expanding or shrinking their wounds. He can also use this ability in order to make weapons. He is able to manipulate the wound by either expanding it to make it more severe or shrinking it to make it less severe. He is seen using this on a Lyakonian soldier when he makes a dent in his arm and expanding the wound in order to weaken them. 

'''Healing:''' Not only is Hideko able to regenerate his missing limbs by drinking someones blood, he is able to use his blood in order to heal others by tracing a blade across his hand and feeding his blood to the injured person. He is seen trying to heal most of Locaster's wounds from his back after Akuji rips his wings off by using his blood. However, if the wound is a large one, it would require for him to use more blood to heal the wound entirely.  

== Weaknesses ==
'''Overuse:''' As a demon, Hideko is prone to overusing his powers. Being a flesh demon, his main abilities are blood-dependent when having to create a weapon or attempting to heal a wound with his blood. When he overuses his abilities, he will show visible signs of fatigue because of blood-loss and sometimes dizziness.  

'''Acid:''' Hideko is prone to acid burns, and when attacked with acid can cause extreme amounts of damage to his skin, as seen when Crow launched an acid attack on the group and a portion of his skin turned red. Acid can also hinder his biokinesis due to it being less effective after.   

'''Blood Loss:''' As a flesh demon, Hideko's magic mainly requires him using his blood in order to make weapons.

'''Vivian "Veena" Lu'''  is a supporting character in a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. She is an owner of the spirit shard that came from the Spirit gem. In the roleplay, Veena is one of the most knowledgable individuals that has gathered information about the demon gems and was able to obtain Crow Watanabe's murder book, which listed all the shard users that he would target next or later.  

== History ==
Not much of Veena's past is told, and little is known about her early upbringing. Her mother had died when she gave birth to Veena and her father was never in the picture of her life because of her parents marital problems. She was primarily raised by her grandmother for an extended period of time after her father had given her up to his grandmother due to not wanting to be reminded of her deceased mother. When she grew older, she learned how to take care of herself and how to help her grandmother because of her being too ill to take care of her.   

When she was a young adult, Veena had moved out of her grandmothers home and settled in western Azuren, a mostly watery climate with many ponds and waterfalls and built a small cottage for herself to live in. Before Veena became a shard user, she lived a relatively quiet life as a young adult and did not have much to do other than explore the new environment that she settled in for a brief period of time.    

Veena had discovered her shard when noticing it sitting on a rock that was near a nearby waterfall. Soon after taking it and attaching the gem to her choker, she realized that it had spirit-like abilities and started to experiment with the powers until she was proficient enough to use it in dire situations. After years of self training, Veena begun to defend herself with her shard's new found powers. Eventually, Locaster had found her roaming in the northern and southern kingdoms and recruited her, making her one of the first and earliest shard user members.       

Veena was discussing the Founding Demon gems with the group, along with Locaster and many others being fascinated that a human was able to possess a shard. Kahori had, however, cut the moment short as she signaled that both Damios and Esper were in incredible danger. As Locaster, Soul and Kahori went to assess damages, Veena quickly located both Esper and Damios who were both restrained. She transforms into her spirit form to unlock their restrains and heal them both as Locaster, Kahori and soul were fighting enemies.          

== Appearance ==
''(NOTE: this character has two appearances: one Animal Jam model, and one Gacha Club model. The Gacha Club model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam Models and Gacha Club Models are used to show them both In animal jam and as an actual person.)''

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Veena is a tall woman with a peach complexion, silver-white eyes and long, silver hair that is the length of her ankles. Around her head is a flower crown with white roses and on her left ear is a white earring that is connected with two beads. Her spirit form resembles Pangur Ban from Secret of Kells, except a lighter blue color and slightly longer in length.    

Veena don's a light blue shirt with darker sleeves and a white, diamond-shaped armor with a mute blue diamond in the middle. She also wears a white skirt and white stockings Around her neck, she wears a thick, black choker that has her shard dangling down from the center, a white flower crown decorated with white roses, and gray boots with white diamonds set in a vertical pattern and a white earring that dangles down her ear. Veena wears bandages around her arms due to being injured in a fight with another child when she was younger.    

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Veena's Animal Jam Model consists of an arctic wolf with a dark gray outer fur and pale inner fur with lighter gray swirl patterns. 

== Personality ==
Veena has been shown to be a calm individual, mainly keeping her cool in intense situations and has little to no reactions in dangerous situations. She often assists Locaster in his group when needed and has shown to be knowledgable about the Demon Gems and their history. Though, Veena has demonstrated to be stoic, but not completely emotionless; She speaks in a refined and posh tone while having a rather cold expression. Despite her rather stoic and inept demeanor, she can be quick to anger, screaming at Cereza for coddling Arcana because of how she is young and displayed as vulnerable. She does, however, regret saying certain things easily and often doubts herself after saying certain things she does not intend to let out and has a hard time articulating her worlds in a more kinder manner.             

According to Hikage, Veena has a craving for both maternal and paternal love: Having her mother die when giving birth to her and her father leaving her, she has little to no understanding of parental love and had to take care of herself a majority of her life while having her grandmother assist her through all of it.             

Veena is described as very honest, hardly sugarcoating anything she says and only tells people the truth; She does so by telling Locaster that things can get more complicated overtime and he cannot expect everyone to come back alive from their battles. With her honesty also comes with her difficulty of lying because of how she is only used to being rather down-to-earth, often stammering on her words when trying to deceive someone and has a hard time coming up with believable lies. She has also shown to have a large distaste for being called by her first name or nicknames like "Vegetable," which both Ashton and Hideko call her in a teasing manner, and prefers simplistic nicknames that are not insulting.               

However, despite Veena's tranquil and calm disposition, she has shown to loosen up when she is around Hikage or any of her friends, as seen when she starts to actively socialize when in the Luckyside Tavern. She begins to become more loosened and dropped her usual calm nature and opted for a more talkative, energetic disposition. She begins to actively socialize with the group, laughing and smiling while still keeping her distance from them at the same time, but can also become slightly hostile; This is seen where Ashton decides to call Veena "Vegetable" as a nickname and nearly punched him in the face.                 

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' As a spirit shard user, Veena is a powerful and skilled combatant. It is stated by Hikage and Nabi that she is incredibly talented despite her only being eighteen. She was able to easily overpower Crow when he had attempted to steal her shard in the past and many non-shard user demons, like Hideko and Ashton. After managing to flee from the Lyakonian soldiers for a brief amount of time, her skill further increased when she managed to quickly heal Hikage's wound and hide her in a tree for a little bit of time so she can rest and not get injured further.  

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Veena possesses enhanced speed and reflexes, swiftly out-pacing Shizuka during their time as enemies and effortlessly running away from soldiers while having to carried an injured Hikage. She had also managed to evade several of the Lyakonian soldiers attacks that were being launched at her, despite their fleet being the most enhanced of all kingdoms.    

'''Enhanced Strength:''' Veena has also proven to have enhanced strength, kicking down soldiers effortlessly and managing to land a hit on Akuji with a single punch that ultimately let his guard down. Her strength is further proven when she casually punches Ashton in the face as a joke for teasing her about the nickname "Vegetable," and also managing to knock down many of the Lyakonian soldiers effortlessly with the help of Hikage.    

'''Enhanced Durability:''' Veena's body is incredibly durable, being able to withstand many crucial injuries when in battle, as seen when her arm is nearly cut off by The Dark Entity during their final battle and getting shot in the leg by a Lyakonian soldier. She was also able to hold Hikage while spinning around a spirit shield to protect her and Hikage from the soldiers without getting tired.          

'''Enhanced Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Veena possesses above average stamina and endurance, resisting many attacks being inflicted on her effortlessly and managed to stay in the same physical and emotional state as she was before.

&lt;/gallery&gt;|caption-image1=|Location=Ezarva, Lyarik|govtype=Constitutional monarchy &lt;small&gt;(formerly)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autocratic absolute monarchy|HOF=Royal Council|Rulers=Caius Astrada|Inhabiters=Akuji Hasegawa, Cassian Packard|Formerinhab=Ashton Khanh, Hideko Inazuma, Shizuka Ikami}}

'''Lyakon''', officially known as '''The Kingdom of Lyakon''' and formerly known as '''Illyria''', is a kingdom located in the center of Lyarik's island of Erzarva and borders Azuren to the east after being split to create a border to display Lyakon's independence from their rule. Despite being connected to Azuren via the border, they are one of the kingdoms who do not recognize themselves being apart of the [[Five Kingdoms]] due to being a separate continent that is connected via a border.      

The Lyakonian-Azurian border is connected by the forbidden forest that leads to western Leiden that is both heavily sectored and guarded daily due to Lyakonian defectors attempting to escape. Formed by the Astrada clan during the Azurian-Illyrian War, the kingdom quickly rose to power after using several war tactics against Azuren, leading to their technology to become more advanced than the kingdoms located within Azuren.    

The kingdom is separated into three divisions: The first division, Ilya, one of the wealthiest, highly urbanized divisions where the main kingdom (sometimes called the capital) is located, The second division, Lysa, the middle class division that is also highly urbanized and wealthy, and the third division, Isaya, the third class.    

The economy of Lyakon is the second largest due to their exports of natural resources and fishing, along with gold and copper exports that help assist nations that are in need of an alliance. Due to their exporting of goods, they have been seen as the bread basket of all the nations.     

Despite both Illya and Lysa being highly developed, the island of Isaya's development is very low due to poverty and a lack of jobs in the area. Without much funding, both sectors do not have proper education or jobs many could get as they are often left to starve and to fend for themselves. Human rights issues in Lyakon further grow because of their use of child soldiers and the extreme abuse towards them.    

== History ==

=== Early History ===
Not much is known about the early history of the kingdom, but it had originated during 1275 BC, during the great war between Lyarik, formerly known as '''Illyria''' at the time as it was one of Azuren's colonies, and was at war with them due to wanting to become an independent nation. The kingdom of Lyakon was formed by the Astrada clan, a somewhat aristocratic family that consisted of powerful and extremely talented combatants that had assisted in defending the ailing soldiers that were quickly getting defeated by the Azurian soldiers because of their technologically advanced weapons and magic.         

Though, it is unclear how the war had ended, it has been implied that they had managed to outsmart them through psychological warfare and taking advantage of the environment that Lyarik has, such as high mountains and rather damp forests that Azurian soldiers were unable to adjust to because of their rather flat lands and smooth mountains. With this, Illyria was changed to Lyarik to symbolize that they were not simply an Azurian colony, along with them changing their flag.            

=== Rise to power ===
After the war, Lyarik had established their kingdom and slowly started to climb up the ranks and recovered from the and became a nationwide power because of their quick advancement after independence. Many individuals had started to immigrate in order to have a more sustainable life. Most migrants came from parts of Azuren, such as Etherin and Leiden at the time, and they started to build homes and sustain themselves. Businesses begun to flourish and jobs had begun to open up for everyone, including hybrid creatures that many did not want accept.     

The citizens enjoyed equal amounts of freedom under king Osias' rule and were able to travel to Azuren and to other countries like Soraya freely. As the citizens enjoyed their freedom, Azuren was attempting to fix their relationship in order to form an alliance with Lyakon. Though, things had still remained sour, but Azuren would still help and assist them as reparation for the damage they had caused and issued a formal apology to the kingdom for their misdemeanors and hoping to mend their disputes in the future     

Even though Azuren had apologized to them formally, their feud was still fresh and soured by the minute. They did provide assistance and Lyakon accepted it, but they still did not want to be associated with them because of their actions. Despite their souring relationship, the people had lived freely and had little to no restrictions whatsoever. Being abundant in natural resources, Lyakon's economy started to flourish after opening up about the idea of trading with other kingdoms. Because of their immense uranium and gun powder stock, Lyakon was at some point called the gun powder kingdom.        

Lyakon was once a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, where the king would not make the decisions alone and had a parliament in order to help him and to not allow him to have full rule. This proved to be useful because of how the citizens had equal freedom, including demons, a very rare occurrence for the time. After the war between humans and demons, demons were frowned upon in Azuren, but were seen as good in Lyakon because of how they recognized them as human and not what the taboos and bad omens said.                  

=== Banishment of Caius Astrada ===
Despite all of Lyakon's praise for being one of the freest kingdoms, one of their major scandals was banishing Caius Astrada, one of the older sons next in line to the throne. Because of his authoritarian mindset and his distaste towards demons, the Astrada Clan did not want him ruling because he would impose a tyrannical rule upon the kingdom, much to their disdain.            

As a result, he was removed from the lineage and banished, but still having a strong claim to the throne. As Caius served as a general for Etherin's army, he was easily influenced by the politics that surround it about authoritarianism and dictatorship. The family had no choice but to banish him because of how much of a threat he imposed on the kingdom; Though they still loved and cherished him, they did not have any other resolution and made his claim to the throne illegitimate.           

As he was banished, Caius was angered by being abandoned by his own family. In an act of revenge had decided to plan an overthrow, where he and many of Etherin's soldiers started to prepare a coup d'état that would overthrow his brother from the throne and make him next in line. While planning, Caius started to coordinate how they would get rid of his brother from the throne and he will be the next ruler via usurping the throne.

NOTE - I am Sorry, But i don't think I will be Continuing this, I have added some more things but only the Story will be Actually Completed, Oh and Also, I might still Edit this Sometimes to Correct Mistakes and Add more Details. 

If you Die as a Consequence of a Choice, Don't Worry, You can Restart!   

This CYOA's Story Version - [https://wildworks-writing.fandom.com/wiki/The_phantom_forest_(Story)?so=search] (I Recommend Playing this First, Or the it will Spoil everything.)   

== Prologue ==
You are a (Your Gender) Gray and White Fox With Blue eyes, Wearing a Spiked Collar and your Name is (Y/N). 

One day Pearl/Silver Was on a Trip, And was Sailing a Boat, (Y/P) Stopped Near a Island With a Mountain, Covered In a Forest (Y/P) had Never Seen Before. 

Out of Curiosity, (Y/P) was Just About to Enter the Island Before (Y/P) stopped and Thought :

'''Is it Safe?''' 

What do you do? continue or Sail away? 

== Continue ==
Out of Curiosity, You Stepped on the Island, You Walked For a Few minutes Before Approaching Purple Trees. 

As soon as You Enter the Strange, Purple Forest, You see Phantom Goop. 

For one Moment you hesitate to Continue and Think of Going Back, But your Curiosity Again Wins, As You Continue Through the Forest, You Trip Over a Branch, You Fell down and Fainted Before you could see how it Looked, But You Knew that It Was a Spiky Purple Branch, Which Didn't Look Natural. 

You wake up at a Cage. (Check "Into the Fortress" For Continuing)

== Sail away ==
You approach you Boat, And Quickly start Sailing, But a Blurry Figure From the Corner of Your Eye Quickly Hit You with Something Spiky, Strange Dark Creatures With tentacles, You Realized They were Phantoms, About 10 of Them, One of them Zapped you, And You Fainted.

You wake up and Find Yourself in a Cage.  (Check "Into the Fortress" For Continuing)

== Into the Fortress ==
You Wake up, And Find Yourself In a Cage, You sit up and See the Door for your Cage was Locked, The phantoms Guarding were Luckily, Sleeping.

You See Two Cages Beside Yours, One In the Left, Where there Was a Brown Bunny With White Patches, With Green Eyes, Wearing  Orange Crystal Pegasus Wings And Green Heart Leg Warmers, She Looked Calm Yet Scared. 

On the Right, There was a Black Horse, With a Pink Mane and Tail, Wearing a Cowboy Hat, Rare Heart Scarf and Elegant Boots, She Looked Aggressive and Overconfident. 

You Decide to Talk to One of Them, But Which One? And For what, Trying to Make a Plan to Escape or Get to Know this Place better?

Options :

Talk to the Bunny - Make a Plan

Talk to the Bunny - Get to Know more

Talk to the Horse - Make a Plan

Talk to the Horse - Get to Know more

== Talk to the Bunny - Make a Plan ==
You Decide to Talk to The bunny, She Gets on Defensive Before Realizing you are not a Threat, You Ask her in a Quiet Voice. 

"Hey, Who are you?"

"I am Flora, An Experienced Prisoner, But who are you?" Flora Replies in a Quiet Voice too. 

"I am (Y/N) Do you want to Get out of this Place?" you reply

"Yes, But I Won't Make a Plan, We Might Get Caught"

"Okay..." You Reply in Disappointment, But you can Still Continue The Conversation and Get to Know more about this Place, Will You talk to the Horse or Continue talking with the Bunny? 

== Talk to the Bunny - Get to Know more ==
You Decide to Talk to The bunny, She Gets on Defensive Before Realizing you are not a Threat, You Ask her in a Quiet Voice.

"Hello, (Y/N) , I am New Here Could you tell me Some Information about This Place?" you asked. 

"I am Flora, I have been Here for a Long time, So Sure! What do you want to know first?"

What Would you Like to Know? 

Options : About this Place, Which Room is where, What Rooms are here, etc. 

Or About the Phantoms, Their Goal,etc.?

== Talk to the Horse - Make a Plan ==
You Quietly Greet the Horse, But the Horse is Loud. 

"Oh hey" You had said. 

"Hello! what are you Doing Here? Do you also Dislike the Phantoms?-" The Horse Started Talking Loudly Before The Phantoms Woke up. 

"Too Bad i know this Trick, GET BACK TO YOUR OWN WORK" One of the Guards said. 

"YES GET BACK TO YOUR WORK UNLESS YOU WANT PUNISHMENT" The other Guard said. 

The Horse,  Even Though Mad, Sat down Quietly and You did the Same. 

Would you like to Wait for the Right Moment and talk to the Horse again? Or do you talk to the Bunny? 

== Talk to the Horse - Get to Know more ==
You Quietly Greet the Horse, But Unfortunately The Horse was Loud. 

"Hello, Could you Please tel-" you Were about to Finish the Sentence before being cut of by The Horse

"Oh Hello! I am Stone! What do you want? Are you on the Phantoms Side?" She Said the Last Sentence a Bit Warily.

Just after a Moment, The guards Woke up. 

"GET BACK TO YOUR OWN WORK" they Said. 

You Two were Annoyed, But Sat down Quietly.

Do you Wait for the Right Moment and talk to the Horse again? or do you Talk to The Bunny?

== Get to Know more - About This Place ==
"So you want to Know more about this Place? Sure" She pointed to a Map of The Fortress Hung At the Wall in Front of The Cages, You were Surprised at How Big it was, Yet knew you Shouldn't have Expected any Less. 

"Here at the Center are those Cages..." She Started Telling all about this Place, But the Guards Woke Up for a Moment, You and Flora Quickly Pretended to be Asleep Before The Phantoms Got Back to their Sleeping again.

Flora waited a Few Minutes Before Continuing, you Could Tell She Was a Careful and Wary Bunny, And that's what Kept Her Safe from The Threat, Whatever the Threat was.

"Just at the Left of the Cages Room, There is the Throne room, At the Right of The Cages Room, There is the Lab, at The front of the Cages Room there is the Maze that Leads to the Entrance, I was about to try it before I Just got Scared."

"A Maze? Sounds Smart but how Do the Phantoms Remember the Way?" You asked. 

" I Don't Know Honestly, But anyways At the Back of the Cages Room is Where the Phantoms hold Meetings, Just beside the Room is the Ladder to The Next Floor, Where There are Bedrooms, The Next floor is the Dining Room, The Workers and The Royalty only Eat together on Special Occasions, And only high rank phantoms get to Spend the Special Occasions with Royalty." She Said. 

" And the Next floor, The Highest floor is Where the Announcements are Held. " Flora Said. 

"Woah..." You were Surprised, At Jamma You had never Seen anything like this. 

"Want to Know Anything Else?" Flora asked. 

Would you like to Know more about the Phantoms? Or Do Something Else? (If you choose to not talk more, You Can either Directly go to "2nd Day" Or Try to Talk to the Horse.)

( I will add an Image of 1st Floor's Map when I learn how to add images, If you know, Please Tell me how to add them, I am on a Mobile By the way) 

== Get to Know more -  About the Phantoms ==
"So, You want to know More about the Phantoms? sure." Flora Said. 

" I don't know Everything, But I know the Phantoms are Up to Something... Possibly to Take over Jamma, Whoever tries to Escape Or do Something to Threaten whatever their Goal is, They Force the Jammer to drink a Potion that Makes them Forgot everything about jamma, And Make them Allies of the Phantoms." Said Flora. 

(Go to "2nd Day" for Continuation, Oh and it will be the the one of the Last Chapters of this CYOA. )  

== 2nd Day ==
It was Midnight, You were Sleeping, But suddenly you Heard a Noise. 

You Woke up, And saw some Phantoms heading to where Flora told was the Announcement Room. 

'''Hmm... If i followed, I would get Useful Information, But might also get Caught.'''

Do you Follow the Phantoms, Or go Back to Sleep? 

== Follow the Phantoms ==
You Followed the Phantoms, Your Darkish Coat Blending in with the Darkness of the Night, You Silently Walk to the Announcement Room, and see the Phantoms Gathering up. 

Do you Hide Somewhere to Listen, Or just Stand and Listen? (If you want to Go back, Go to "Go back to Sleep")

== Go back to Sleep ==
You Go back to Sleep, And Sleep till the Morning.

The Horse/Stone woke you up, You saw the Bunny/Flora  Hiding in a Corner from Fear, And the Phantoms Strengthening the Locks of the Cages. 

Some Phantoms were Also Holding Weapons, And Entering the Maze one by one.

You Realized, They were now Attacking Jamma, You were too Late.

'''If i had Spied on the Announcement last night, I could have Done Something, I Could have Warned everyone, And we Could Have Saved Jamma....'''

But you Pushed the Thoughts away, You couldn't have Done much in a Few Hours anyways. 

(That's All, I will only be Working on the Story now, But feel Free to Imagine what Happens Next Or Replay this, Or Check out the Story [https://wildworks-writing.fandom.com/wiki/The_phantom_forest_(Story)?so=search])

== Hide and Listen ==
You Hid in a Dark Corner, Where there Were no Seats Nearby. 

A Huge Phantom, With a Purple Crown Maybe made of a Gem you studied that is Found near Phantom Places, Climbed on a High Place, The Phantom was Maybe their King. 

The King Began his Speech, "Phantoms, Finally after Countless Decades of Preparing for the Attack on Jamma, It is Time to Attack."

The Other Phantoms Cheered Loudly, You Covered your Ears so the Noise won't be So Loud. 

Finally, After the Noise Stopped, You Took off your Paws from your ears again.

"The Prisoners might be up to Something, so I would like to Command some of you to Strengthen the Locks of the Cages, And the rest Please Be prepared with yours Weapons to Go and Attack Jamma." The King Continued.

One of the Phantoms, With Blue-Gray Splotches on Him said "Of Course, You can Count on us."

"Good, Now you all Can go back, And Remember, Be prepared to Attack." The King said, And Floated away, The Other Phantoms Slowly Floated away too, Until only you were Left.

You waited for Everyone to Go back to their Bedrooms, and Quickly got back to your Cage.

'''Thank you so much to Phxcon for drawing him!'''    

'''Akuji Hasegawa''' is a major antagonist of a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. He is a bounty hunter that works for the National Army of Lyakon. He is responsible for blackmailing Ashton into joining the army due to him being a demon. He has been shown to be a clear favorite of the king, as he is mainly sent out for missions very frequently, usually to capture defectors and send them back or hunt down hybrids for the black market economy of Lyakon.     

== History ==
Akuji was the oldest of three siblings and grew up in the same district of Lyakon as Ashton. He worked as a thief in order to support his family due to Estelar's extreme famine and lack of funding from the capital. He often had to work long hours to get the supplies his family needed and deeply cared for his parents and three siblings by prioritizing them over himself. Even when they had food, Akuji would give larger portions for his family instead of himself.     

Due to being the only one in the family that is physically fit, he usually was seen as the breadwinner of his family because of him being able to steal an abundant amount of food with little to no effort, and managed to keep his family afloat by stealing what he could to ensure survival for him and his family.  

One day when stealing, he had gotten into a fight with a group children from the second division of Lyakon, but he had quickly overpowered them after nearly being assaulted and almost had his food taken away. Being beaten by a third division individual, The fight had resulted in him getting followed home without his knowledge after they had tipped the soldiers of Lyakon about him stealing as an enactment of revenge.        

After he had walked home to give food to his family, many guards from Lyakon had shown up at his home to simply take Akuji away to draft him into the military. Despite his attempts of refusal for the sake of his siblings and family, the guards proceeded to drag him out, ignoring his pleas to release him. Even though he resisted, he was still heavily outnumbered, and was taken away from his family, and his struggling was intense enough to a point where the soldiers had to sedate him. Afterward, he was sent to the Lyakonian army base to train to be a soldier, permanently separated from his family and unsure of when he can see them again.       

At the base, Akuji was both physically and psychologically abused by his trainers, often berated harshly for mistakes he would often make and was constantly overworked. His trainers would often beat him with a stick to force him into submission if he ever attempted to fight back or when he did not give a satisfactory performance. He was forced to go on long shifts without breaks and often was exhausted. He was constantly stressed and was also homeless, as he would often have to sleep in a tree when his shifts were over, though at times they wouldn't be over until the morning. Because of all the stress and abuse he faced, his personality slowly shifted into a rather cold and malevolent one and started to take pride in his job, despite knowing how wrong it felt.              

At some point, Akuji had became the favorite of Caius for a brief period of time, always standing by the throne and often sent out on missions on his behalf and even alluded to being "more than a favorite" of him once, also being seen as an object and nothing more. Though, after he was sent out to hunt hybrids, he had eventually found Ashton and recruited him via blackmail. Ashton then replaced Akuji as the favorite a couple of years later after he begun to outshine Akuji. As he viewed Ashton as himself when he was younger, he treated him the exact same way he was treated when being forced into the military.               

Akuji's personality further took a shift as he started to physically, emotionally and verbally abuse Ashton and frequently took his rage and anger out on him without showing it on his face. As a result of his abuse, Ashton started to grow a fear of Akuji in his later years. The two were still partnered up together despite of Ashton's fear, and Akuji would often pressure him into killing the innocent by using coercion to do so. He often resorted to canning him if he did not excel in his training and forced him to hold boulders on his shoulders for hours on end in order to make him miserable. Akuji had also killed a girl that Ashton had feelings for all for the sake of making him lonely and without anyone that can help him. As Akuji's behavior began to escalate, Ashton developed an extreme fear of being near him whenever having to do partner work.                 

== Appearance ==

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Akuji is a tall man of Japanese descent with gray-ish skin and white eyes with a scar on his face. He has long, raven-black hair that goes down to his back tied in a braid and a dark blue musketeer had that is slightly tilted. Underneath his left eye is a beauty mark and his right eye has a scar that expands across his face.    

Akuji wears a typical mercenary outfit:  A gray, body armor like shirt with rolled up sleeves, a green cape with two black pieces of fabric that dangle in the front, a belt with two leather straps curled, black military pants and gray boots with light blue decals. On the left side of his waist, he wears a gun holster that holds a double barrel gun inside.    

As a child, Akuji's hair was down and rather messy and the scar on his right eye is absent. He wears a tan shirt with ripped up gray pants, bandages around his arm and brown boots.     

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Akuji's Animal Jam Model is an arctic wolf with a black outer fur and a dark gray inner fur. He has white eyes and star patterns that are all over his fur. Akuji wears a huntress hat with a black spike collar around his neck, hunter boots, tail belts, and hunter garb. He often carries around a double barreled gun that is concealed in a sack.   

== Personality ==
Though appearing rather smooth-talking and polite on the surface, Akuji is an apathetic and condescending individual, having little to no attachment to anyone around him and has a hard time forming bonds, only seeing them as a role to merely fufill. When on duty, he often displays a peppy, yet playful demeanor, but often teases his targets and can be rather sadistic when doing so, taunting Locaster about killing Soul Kawasaki after ripping off his wings without any qualms. Being the king's right hand man, Akuji is a swift and agile individual, having the ability to kill targets without any hardship or difficulty and is heavily favored by the king, being able to say what he pleases to Cassian and other high ranking officials in the kingdom.         

According to Ashton, Akuji is both intimidating and ruthless, often displaying abusive behavior towards other people and viewing his vile behavior as normal. Since Akuji abused Ashton during their time training, he finds satisfaction for mercilessly taunting and teasing Ashton in a crude, yet playful manner about personal events he had gone through and showed little empathy towards him. Akuji is a psychopath and did harmful actions to others simply for the reaction, taking Cassian's earring in order to anger him just to see if his reaction was worth seeing, even going as far into killing a girl Ashton had liked solely to see his reaction and make him miserable.        

Akuji has shown to be less prone for when people attempt to expose him for his actions, slapping Ashton across the face after he had confronted him on his abusive behavior and how he did not help him after a certain event, leading him to often use threats and his physical prowess in order to scare them into submission. Along with his intimidating appearance, his choice of words are described as harsh, bordering on cruelty, often using profanity without any restraint and can come off as severe.          

Akuji has shown to be delighted whenever he has opponents, praising Locaster for his use of his dark magic, complimenting Ashton on his improved technique and going as far into sparing him because he views Ashton as a "fun opponent." However, this side of him is hardly shown, as he banters about how he was able to kill many demons without having to fight them because of his prowess.          

Akuji is both arbitrarily cruel and harsh and shows little to no concern for those who do not abide by Lyakon's rule. He perceives newer recruits to the army as weak with no potential whatsoever due to his superiority complex of being stronger than others. With his superiority complex comes with his behavior towards others, as he switches his personality depending on the person he is around, whether it is for deception or to have a simple conversation with. Akuji is also rather disrespectful, taunting Cassian about his fear of landmines and making crude remarks about his fathers death, but can only be respectful if he is threatened or is near someone higher in command.           

As a child, however, his personality was the exact opposite of the cruel and rather harsh persona he now adapts: When he was younger, Akuji would always put others above himself and was described to be sweet, helpful and very protective of his family, going to the extremes to ensure their survival and does not take care of himself because of him caring for other people around him. He was described by Hideko during their brief conversation as children as generous and caring to those around him before being dragged into the army.             

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilites:''' As a soldier, Akuji is a very powerful, yet dangerous combatant. It has been stated by both Ashton and Locaster that he is one of the more stronger opponents the both of them have faced. He was able to withhold many attacks from Hideko and Ashton as the both of them attempted to surprise attack him but failing, He was able to put up a fight with all members of the group without difficulty. His combination of both his skilled use in weaponry and combat makes him one of the more larger threats the group had faced, the second big threat being Crow. He, at first, does not fight seriously in order to ease his opponents in and only gets serious when his opponent is fooled.  

'''Deception:''' Being trained in a harsh environment, Akuji has incredible deception skills, having the ability to fool others around him by displaying a friendly, smooth-talking facade that is able to fool all but the more keen observants. Ashton and Hideko were quickly able to see through his facade, the other members following up. His ability to deceive becomes an advantage he often uses because of how he gained the trust of many other individuals before killing them of. This was shown when Akuji had managed to fool Locaster into eating a drug-laced brownie in order to save Ashton from being executed and his secret of being a quarter of a demon come out.  

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' As a soldier for one of the largest armies, Akuji is extremely fast, being able to catch up to Ashton effortlessly and outpacing Shizuka in her tracks; His speed is sometimes described as being inhuman-like, sometimes being fast enough it appears he teleported. His impeccable speed was further exemplified when he managed to catch up to Ashton and nearly slam him into the ground. His reflexes are also equally as fast, dodging many of Locaster's powerful spells and attacks and managing to evade Shay's many ambushes, despite him being a Lieutenant.    

'''Enhanced Strength:''' As a soldier in the National Army of Lyakon, Akuji possesses incredible and nearly inhuman-like strength. This is shown when he manages to punch down Ashton and nearly knock down Shay with only a simple kick. According to Yuna, Akuji's strength is on the caliber of a demons and nearly surpasses Ashton in strength because of Akuji being in the military for a longer time than him. Even when he was a child, his strength has been described to be unmatched, so much so that he was able to save himself from getting beaten by upper rank children. He was also strong enough to rip Locaster's wings out of his back without difficulty.     

'''Enhanced Durability:''' Akuji has proven to have an incredibly durable body. This is shown when Cassian nearly smothers him for taking his earring, but still remained unfazed. This is further proven when Hideko had attempted to shoot his arm with the bullet, cutting his skin and creating a huge dent, but proved to not flinch when being faced with this. His durability is further proven when Ashton used his metal pipe to nearly break his wrist, but managed to resist the pain that came with it.     

'''Menacing Aura:''' Akuji has demonstrated to have a menacing and rather overwhelming presence, managing to scare Locaster into taking his drug-laced brownie in order to save Ashton from both being outed as a demon and being killed. His aura is further exemplified when Hideko, one of the more brash members, falls into silence when he gets punched in the stomach by him during their awaiting trials.      

'''Keen Intellect:''' Being both harshly trained and carefully educated by both Cassian and Caius, Akuji has demonstrated to be incredibly intelligent. He was able to ambush the group with ease by carefully preparing and planning out how they were going to send Ashton back by making a mass ambush. He has also proven to be knowledgable in combat, as seen where he correctly predicts every move from Damion. He was also aware that he was a former Founding Demon, and while not being a shard user, possesses knowledge on some of the demon gems.     

'''Enhanced Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Akuji has proven on several occasions to have inhuman-like stamina and endurance, shown when going one on one with Ashton and not showing an inch of exhaustion or being tired. This is proven during his one on one battle with Ashton, nearly knocking him to the ground and nearly pouncing on him when he realized he was overusing his abilities and barely flinched when Ashton and Damion used more of their larger spells on him, continuing to fight in a nonchalant manner.       

== Equipment ==
'''Double Barreled Shotgun:''' Akuji's main weapon of choice is a double barreled shotgun, used for hunting down hybrids and designed to be used at further distances, as shown when he was able to shoot Damion through the shoulder from a faraway angle. He has also used his gun multiple time around Ashton during his training by making him run through a forest and shooting him at far distances so he can attempt to avoid the many bullets flying at him. 

== Weaknesses ==
'''Reliance:''' Akuji's main weakness is reliance on his weapon, as he is beater with weapon-to-weapon combat instead of hand-to-hand, despite being efficient in the two. This results in him having to rely on his gun too much. Without his gun or being out of bullets, he is considered much weaker. 

'''Expose:''' Akuji is not prone to being called out for his heinous and lecherous actions. If called out, he will ultimately lash out and use physical violence as a threat or as a way to keep things on the low. This is seen when Ashton calls Akuji out on not trying to help him, but he had eventually slapped Ashton across the face due to him calling Akuji out for his abusive and crude behavior. 

'''Hand-to-hand Combat:''' Those exceeding in this category of combat, Akuji has proven to lack some skill in it, easily being knocked down by Ashton due to not having his gun. While he still exceeds, this type of combat can greatly hinder his ability to fight because of his weak hand muscles. 

'''Underestimation:''' Having a superiority complex, Akuji mostly undermines the individuals he fights because of his view on being the superior out of all soldiers. He is seen underestimating Ashton by taunting him before he nearly lands a hit on him, cutting him with his sword. Because of his underestimation of individuals, it can greatly weaken him, especially when challenging proficient fighters. 

== Relationships ==

=== [[Ashton Khanh]] ===
Being Ashton's trainer under his wing, Akuji has a very strained and hostile relationship with him. As he blackmailed Ashton into joining the army in order to not get killed and sold off, Akuji physically and emotionally abused him from when he was fourteen up until he was seventeen, beating him for not achieving the above perfection standard that was common in the military. Because of the abuse, Ashton harbors an immense amount of hatred towards him, while Akuji harbors both envy and hatred. His envy can stem from when he was able to surpass him in talent and combat because of his naturally advanced physiology. 

As a result of Akuji's abuse, Ashton exhibits an extreme fear of him and often freezes whenever he is near or even in close sights. Akuji finds this as a normal reaction because he is supposed to be scared of him. Akuji often taunts Ashton about memories he wanted to forget and traumatic moments in order to psyche him out and put him in a more vulnerable position to ultimately weaken him. When he was younger, he would often beat Ashton as a way to force him into submission whenever the two had an argument or a conflict with one another.    

=== [[Cassian Packard]] ===
Akuji was Cassian's trainee who works under his fleet. When first being introduced to him, Akuji was frightened of him because of his abusive behavior, but was also fascinated by him because of his many talents, such as having the ability to train soldiers effortlessly. Even though he does have a sense of hostility towards him, he perceives Cassian as a puppet he can manipulate because of his vulnerabilities. He enjoys seeing him in a frustrated or agitated state, such as when he took off one of his earrings and made him fight for it back until Akuji was nearly smothered by him or intentionally taunting him for not having a father.  

Taunting him about his father's death, Cassian harbors an immense hatred for him, but cannot retaliate due to Akuji being Caius' right-hand man. He is frequently seen with Akuji because of him being sent on missions the most on Caius' behalf.   

=== [[Locaster Helios]] ===
Though their interactions are fairly limited, Akuji demonstrates to show a disdain for him. He taunted him about Soul's death, bragging how his body parts sold for "a good million runes" and dropping his mask on the floor. However, despite his hatred for him, he shows a particular interest in Locaster because of his empathy and selflessness, taking advantage of it and giving him a drug-laced brownie instead of killing him in order to see how far he would go to save a person.   

=== Caius Astrada ===
Caius Astrada is the current ruler of Lyakon. Being his right-hand man, he shows to maintain a business partner-like relationship with him, often being sent on missions under his name. It is noted by Ashton that Akuji and Caius' relationship is seen as odd by both soldiers and politicians alike because of how they act more like close acquaintances than just a soldier and a king. He is always standing by his  

== Trivia ==

* Akuji is one of three characters with a braid, the other two being [[Misaya Myat]] and [[Cassian Packard]].
* Despite forgetting his old self, Akuji remembers his family vaguely and has not seen them in over four years, but hopes to visit them. 
* Akuji's hatred for Ashton was caused by envy and pure spite: As he saw Ashton improve and surpass him, his envy grew to a point where he made it a goal to make Ashton miserable in any given moment because of his deep envy for him. 
* Akuji is one of the tallest members outside of Locaster's group, being around 6'1 and Cassian being around 6'2. 
* He has a skin condition known as argyria, where instead of his skin being pale like most of his family, his skin is an off gray tone, caused by people who ingest silver. Unlike his family members, Akuji's is the least severe from them. 
* Many soldiers despise him for not only his talents but also his personality. 
* As Akuji is proficient in weapon-to-weapon combat, he was able to kill as many as thirteen people with his shotgun alone.
* Akuji's favorite foods are fried squid and daifuku, along with spicy foods. He, however, is not used to sour or overly-sweet foods. 
* Akuji likes hunting, feeling superior among others and hot springs, but he dislikes Ashton, people that claim to be superior and bugs. 
* According to Cassian, he finds Akuji "stupid" because of his superiority complex.

''A link to the first book: [[Fireworks]]''

Hi again, everyone! Welcome to the second volume of my gay romance miniseries, ''Fireworks.'' In case you were wondering, this volume is just a follow-up to the first: it pretty much focuses on the queer rights movement that Isaac, Simon, and Luka start. I have mentioned my idea for ''The Moon Was High Enough (For Us To Live)'', but this isn't the Luka-and-Kara love story quite yet, hehe. 

==== Fireworks Vol. 2 ====


&lt;u&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/u&gt;

"Simon! Simon, get up-- we're going to the studio! We're filming the interviews! We need to get the petitions! Simon, come on!" Isaac's joyous anticipation woke me up with a jolt. Today was the day!

The petitions and everything... At Johnston Summer Boarding School (surprise-surprise, Mr. Johnston was in charge because it was property he inherited), I hadn't expected to have actually made any of that happen. But with just a few words, I did. Which... wow. Pretty amazing. 

And now, we were at a hotel near a news studio, pre-paid rooms (Luka got their own, smaller room) and all, being interviewed.

AND we had made five full petitions- one, for CHECKS to be removed- two, for Mr. Johnston to be fired- three, for Teddy to face charges for all the s*** he did- four, Mr. Johnston would also face charges (Luka surprisingly knew a lot about the law- apparently, their uncle has his own law firm and told Luka all about it)- and five, the Johnston Summer Boarding School would create a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination, assault, and bullying.

Turns out that a lot of kids attending summer school with us were having a hard time. Some of them, like Luka, were staying year-round- they'd been harassed for varying reasons. One autistic boy, Mars, spoke up about how Mr. Johnston didn't do anything when he reported ableist bullying from Teddy. And apparently, the bullying got ''really'' bad.

I mentioned the time Teddy and his goons (who supposedly felt sorry and regretted everything, saying they wanted attention and wanted to be popular and that they didn't realize how much harm they were doing, they were in it for stupid fun and a laugh and they claimed they didn't enjoy any of it either, that they felt super terrible, which even if they did  feel that way doesn't mean they're innocent)--

Okay, yeah, a lot, but I'm upset at them- as I was saying, though, I spoke up, too. It was kind of tricky. But I brought up the time when Teddy had somehow obtained an airsoft gun (weapons, fake or not, and drugs weren't allowed on the school property, but Mr. Johnston excused it and said there wasn't evidence or witnesses), and what he'd done to Isaac and I that day.

Luka even spoke about Kara. And f***, I wasn't ready for that, because I didn't even know about Kara. And... God. To think that Teddy ever even had a real gun? And that it was simply... excused? He had attempted to murder someone. And nearly succeeded. 

It was so much. Almost too much. But this was important. This could be it. This could be a way to recognize queerness and celebrate queer joy and smite discrimination. Isaac is excited. I am, too. Of course I am. This is huge. And even if I wasn't, it's still too important.

We'd been rehearsing for forever- the news company got us a hotel room to stay at in the mean time, while they interrogated Mr. Johnston- and today was the day. But God, I was late already, I'd slept in until 8:39... forget that, though. 

Seeing Isaac, him waking me up in the morning... it was kind of cute. Really cute. Yeah, I was a fan of it. A big fan.

"Uh- um--" I sputtered nervously, trying to get out of bed without looking like a total doofus in my high-contrast Spongebob pajamas.

I was tired. Everything I've been thinking of, or well, thinking of then, I'd been thinking of last night. So of course I selected the most humiliating clothing choice I could've.

Isaac, of course, laughed at me immediately.  

The embarrassment had already started, but I had prepared an emergency button-up shirt and necktie. Blushing, I stood, and turned to the bathroom to change. 

"No way," Isaac said insistently, still chuckling, "you're wearing those."

"Isaac, noooo! It's an interview. I don't want to publicly humiliate myself!" I groaned, pleading for the sake of my one operating fragment of dignity.

"Come on.  Reporters swarmed over your little rebellious act against Mr. Johnston- they've found a lot more out about him, too, thanks to you. You're a rock star to Jamaa. An attractive one, at that," Isaac smiled, leaning in for a peck on the cheek.

"You are not making me wear Spongebob pajamas. I don't love you that much," I said stubbornly, still blushing as I hugged him, letting all of my feelings pour out, letting him know how happy I was. 

I had sort of just told him I loved him. But he didn't even react to that part of the sentence. Did that count? 

Well, it didn't matter. He looked cute, already dressed in his tuxedo. 

Maybe, just maybe, I ''would'' wear Spongebob pajamas. 

He did seem to think I was cute in them...

"Oh shoot, we're really running late now. Can we make out later?" Isaac called, already flying through the door, though with a smile on his face, at the very least- so I knew he was OK.

"Um- Isaac, wait! I--"

Luka rushed up behind me, grinning from ear to ear. I'd never seen her happier myself, even if she was probably about to make an embarrassing comment. 

"Haven't you already told him that you loved him?" Luka said, softer than I'd expected, with a little bit of a chuckle.

Yep. Embarrassing.

"Well, I-- I mean, we have the interviews, so I just-- and- but- no, I- I mean--" I stammered, shocked that Luka had known what I wanted to say, ''really'' say, so easily.

"Of course, Simon. Of course. You know he loves you, though- and you two don't have to hide anymore. Heck, two thirds of Jamaa's population is hoping to see you make out, no matter how weird and creepy that sounds," Luka said reassuringly, though it really only made my nerves spike further.

== 1. Lights ==
The taxi ride had been long and draining.

Now, I didn't get carsick often, but the trip into the heart of Jamaa Township was a certain exception to the honest statement of mine. The path was riddled with bumps and bends, only increasing my worries. 

If I was going to tell Isaac, what was I going to say?

My original goal of changing earlier that day was to just practice via the mirror technique- but he would have heard that anyway.

And was it too soon? Was it too soon to say that? Would I just be making a fool of myself? Or would I hurt Isaac's feelings somehow?

I sighed to myself, staring through the glossy window of the bright yellow taxi. 

According to the cabman, we were only twenty minutes shy of the city, meaning twenty minutes away from trying to set a romantic scene in the middle of an interview and tell Isaac that I love him.

So, basically, a total train wreck. 

Because what was he going to say? 

''"'Look, it's not that I don't... I mean, that I don't want to go out with you... but I just... I think it's a bit too soon for me to say... &lt;u&gt;that.&lt;/u&gt;"'''

Or worse. Or worse. God, none of those outcomes sounded good at all. 

"Simon? Simon... earth to Simon! Simon! Simon, look!" Isaac practically shouted, his voice even more excited than when he'd dragged me out of bed earlier that morning.

I jumped up in my seat, facing the pains of my overly-fastened seatbelt, and then whipped my head around to Isaac, already terrified of just opening my mouth- because what if I said something? Let something slip? And I did it wrong? There were so many ways to do it wrong...

"Simon, you big idiot... look outside! Through the window!" Isaac called, playfully nudging me, resulting in my face being uncomfortably pressed against the window. 

Though everything felt better with him. With Isaac. How was I supposed to tell him that...?

And finally, my saving grace: a distraction. My family had never been big on vacations or sightseeing, but this... this was more than I'd ever imagined. 

That's saying a lot, since I made up an entire theme park the first time I thought of coming out: the holy Gay Rainbow Pride Greatness Land, which conveniently had all my favorite sports (which there were few of), arcade games (which there were more of), foods, and music (David Bowie, Mariah Carey).

The city was more than that, though. Sure, it wasn't pride flag streamers covering every square inch of wall or gay pride flags held high on golden poles, but it was just... angelic, almost. 

Hanging lights like stars circled the trees, the sunshine dappling their vibrant, luscious green leaves, all reflecting upon dozens of clear, florally-decorated windows, which claimed lurid flowers and elegant vines. The sight of it all, the brightness, the beauty, was amazing.

"Wow," I breathed, not realizing Isaac had slipped his paw into mine. 

"Wow," I said again, feeling even more shaky, yet still strong, with him by my side, seeing this with me-- it made me nervous that I was doing something wrong, or offending him- but he made me feel... wanted. 

My parents never really did that, haha. 

My stomach plummeted. Usually my thoughts didn't turn that way. I was just feeling down because of the Isaac thing- this was just stress getting to me. Once we got to the studio, we'd get some fresh air and a lunchbreak. 

I'd feel fine after that... probably.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Isaac burst out of the car, clearly having pent-up energy. His smile, though, it was incredible, shining like the sun... and he turned to me, and squeezed me, and smiled even harder as he pulled away from another kiss. 

I smiled back, not knowing what to say-- he was the brightest light in my life, always shining. On that day, though, he was shining for more than just me... which I liked. 

I liked everything about him. I loved him. 

I wasn't ready to say it to his face, to admit it. But it was true. It was going to make spending time with him a bit harder...

But what if he loved me back?

What if I was a light to him, too?

There was a chance. I had to remind myself that there was a chance. Isaac Malcher wasn't just some guy that made out with me on the down-low, or some kid saying he pitied me for being gay but he was willing to spend time with me. 

Isaac Malcher was going out with me. That meant that... we were boyfriends. 

I had a boyfriend.

Thinking that satisfied me. But how would I say something? How would I ask ''him'' out?

The question was only bothering me more. 

The thought that had come across me about my parents... that was weighing down on me, too. But I had to stay strong. We were going to do the filming soon- then, it would be time for lunch.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

We walked into the studios. It was time. 

We were introduced to a cougar with a beige underbelly and a tan overcoat, that wore Socks &amp; Sandals, a Black Short Collar, a Founder's Hat, and a dark green tuxedo, whose name was Jeff. 

Jeff was supposedly going to give us a tour of the studios and introduce us to the interviewer, Aeros. 

"It's a pleasure to meet you three! Luka, Simon, Isaac-- the circumstances, I know, are bittersweet- but I've heard clips of your story, and some comments on your experiences-- so I know a little bit about all of you already. Speaking of, what are your pronouns today, Luka?" Jeff asked warmly, looking to Luka expectantly.

"Oh! Today I'm using she/her. Thanks for asking," Luka replied, somewhat surprised, since this wasn't a question she was often asked.

I cracked an awkward smile. It was weird, to be there, at an actual news studio. 

And for everyone around me to have acted like we were best friends, or I was their idol... was also weird. Daresay, weirder than my prior observation.

I hadn't known this Jeff guy. I hadn't known who the heck Aeros was, only that he was supposedly trans, which no one should have told me, since that's something Aeros should say on his own-- so, OK, maybe it would have been kind of impolite to point that out to Jeff. I just...

Lunchtime is before the interviews. Thank God. I need time to process this, still. Maybe, though... maybe I could set aside some time. To talk to Isaac. Maybe...

But then, a turquoise polar bear enters stage left, and has a seat right next to Isaac. Um. What.

"Isaac?" I asked, concerned, "there room for me? I kind of wanted to, uh..."

"Oh," Isaac said, "yeah. Yeah, um. Uh--" he looked to Aeros apologetically, "Do you mind? Sorry, just... You know. Simon's my.... Well. Simon and I just wanted to talk."

Aeros' face reddened. He was embarrassed. He was leaving, though. But Isaac... didn't say we were dating. Which meant we weren't on the same page. Which meant he didn't... oh. 

Oh, s***. Was he... was he breaking up with me?

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"It's a nice day today," Isaac said, smiling. 

He wasn't selling it. I was shaking all over, not even caring about what the awkward leeway would be like, just terrified of the facts, the thing he was about to say. 

I knew this wouldn't last, I knew it, but I really did love him, I loved Isaac, and I never wanted to hurt his feelings or make him feel pressured or--

And then everything just fell out. Just like that, I was completely deflated.

"Isaac, I'm so, so, sorry, I didn't want to pressure you to kiss me or-- or-- go out with me, I guess- or even go on one date with me in the first place-- I just-- I really thought that- 

"I'm sorry and I- I didn't mean to do anything to hurt you, I really didn't, and I know you hate me and you want to break up with me and you probably never even had any feelings for me but if I'm not a total bigoted creep to you then please just give me one more chance- 

"Please, at least let me just be your friend, because I'm really sorry, and I promise I won't ever do anything like this again, and that--"

I was crying. 

My eyes were blurred with tears, and it felt like the little bit of salt was stinging them, trying to numb the pain in a way, but reality was all around me, right in front of me, even the past-- my parents' voices, them arguing the night I came out, everything, everything at once...

Luka approached. She raised a paw to place on my shoulder, then hesitantly glanced at Isaac.  

She then walked away towards the turquoise polar bear, who now sat at another table in the courtyard, frowning. 

"Si," Isaac whispered. "Hey, Si. Why don't you have a seat? It sounds like we have a lot to talk about. But before we start, let me clear something up. I'm about as straight as your hair right now, okay? And there's no way in hell I'm breaking up with you." 

I... he was sugarcoating it. He didn't think it would hurt me this much, did he? Haha. 

"Si," Isaac repeated, "everything is going to be OK. Everything is going to be OK. You hear me? Repeat after me, Si: Everything is going to be OK."

"You're... you're breaking up with me. You don't have to lie. I... I get why," I said, shivering, hoping that my chills and my nerves would just go away, now that I knew what Isaac thought.

"No. No, I'm not. Simon. Simon, please. I..."

He wasn't going to say those three words.

"Simon Larring, I want to be your boyfriend."

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I wasn't sure what kind of tears were sliding down my cheeks. 

I was sweaty. And nervous.

Because what was this?

Did he just say "I love you?"

Or did he ask me out?

What?

I was confused. Very confused. 

I looked up at him. He was right there, right in front of me, kind of smiling. Kind of? What was I thinking?

"Did you just break up with me then get back together with me?"

What. Did. I. Just. Say. 

Isaac laughed. He. Laughed. God, I missed his laugh...

What was I even doing? This was crazy. Crazy.

I was still crying. I was so, so happy. And sad. Why was I sad?

"Isaac, God, I..."

"You're an idiot, Simon. An adorable idiot."

"I ''am'' sorry. I ''am'' an idiot."

"Don't be hard on yourself. That's not anyone's job, especially yours."

"That's not what people usually say," I replied dryly, trying to drain out the rest of my tears.

"Hey, Si. Are you sure you're alright? I mean..."

"I'm fine," I said, throwing on a smile as quickly as possible. "Everything's great. We're going to do the interviews soon!"

"We can take a break. We can ask to film later. We can have the night to ourselves," Isaac offered, grabbing my paw. "We can just hang out."

"Just... just hang out," I repeated loopily.

"Yeah," Isaac said, "that sounds good." He smiled. Again.

There was a lot of smiling. I liked that. Isaac made me smile. I made Isaac smile.

It was kind of magic. I'd never expected it. That checks off the first box, haha. And, I mean... just... this was a dream. A literal dream. Come alive. Breathing. Heart, beating. Beautiful...

I cherished this. It was everything. 

Isaac leaned in for a kiss, a little cheekily. He held my paws, and we embraced each other. 

The birdsong became romantic, and took another turn, and soon there was an orchestra, each instrument playing softly, with peace, with gratitude, with care. The world slowed down, and soon Isaac took me into his arms, and it was like a hug, but better, because it was Isaac...

He guided me. He saw for me. He took me through a series of motion: stepping backwards, and forwards, and to the left, and to the right... a box step. A slow dance.

He smiled. I smiled. There was so much smiling. There was music filling the air. Everything was perfect. 

I pushed closer, clumsily stepping over him. Perfect, still. He slipped up as I rebalanced, but it was still perfect. 

His tender lips met mine. A rush of emotion poured through our kisses, a river of song, a river of beauty... a vast river. 

His paws gently grazed my cheeks. Cautiously, he sheathed his claws. Warmth, emitting from my body, from his...

A flame, engulfed in hope, in embarrassment, in laughter, in glee, in mischief, in satisfaction, in mistakes, in misunderstanding, in sorrows, in tears, in grief, in scolding, in mockery, in teasing, in flirting, in smiles, in jokes, in kisses...

Associated with long walks in the park that came with ice cream and hot dogs, with awkward failed attempts at flirtation, with solitary moments of the most wonderful sort of quiet, with Friday night movies and pepperoni pizza, with secret afterschool kisses, with staying up too late at sleepovers and just talking about life, with soaring hopes and childhood dreams and long-lost wishes.

Lights, everywhere.

== 2. Aeros ==
"Er, hey. I'm Aeros. One of the reporters here. I was going to be interviewing you two..." 

The turquoise polar bear from earlier stood awkwardly beside us. Isaac laughed and pushed me aside, which I found somewhat offensive. 

It still hurt, though... I really thought Isaac was going to break up with me. Guess I didn't know much about love. I deliberately thought that my boyfriend was straight.

He didn't say he loved me...

Maybe it was too soon. Maybe something else was going on. I didn't want to rush this. I wanted it to last, I wanted it to be as a beautiful a story as Isaac himself... Isaac, he really was a prince. 

"...So I thought that we could do it at different times, different days. It would make it easier for all of us, I think."

"Yeah! Sounds great. Simon and I wanted to have dinner first, since it's getting late... Oh! Maybe we could get to know each other, though, so it's not so awkward. We were planning to spend some time together, the three of us... but if you have time in your work schedule, you could join us," Isaac answered, looking to Aeros.

"What? Dinner? When?" I questioned, jumping up in confusion. 

I wasn't even paying attention. Stupid, stupid. Aeros was standing there, still looking kind of shy and unsure. 

He had been talking, definitely. What about, though? Wait... Aeros was having dinner with us? We were having dinner with some random journalist?

Was this someone who knew Mr. Johnston? Was Aeros going to twist our words? Did he really know everything we'd gone through? Did he even know us? What was going to happen with this? 

This was all me. It was all my fault. I'd been the one who started the whole thing. But no, something had to be done about Mr. Johnston. This wasn't just about me. Luka needed support. Someone had to stand up for her. 

The only people that were willing to do that in the first place were Isaac and I. This was our job, regardless of what we wanted... regardless of what I wanted.  

This went beyond my dreams. I wished that this could just be my dreams, and only my dreams. Not yet. I had to fight. This was the right thing to be doing. 

And besides, this didn't negatively affect us. Really, it would give us more nights for ourselves, where we really were ourselves...

"Alright, Simon! Aeros is going to come with us for dinner. So he can get to know us better before the interview. He said it wasn't protocol, but he felt like it would just be better if we did. We just need to figure out where we actually want to go, haha. I assumed you wanted a place with fries and milkshakes, since those are the only two things you eat," Isaac joked.

"Well, you know, I thought it would just be us, and that we could ''share'' a milkshake," I whined, though it was kind of true, because I did want to have more one-on-one time... it was selfish, though. This was for more than that.

"Come on, Si. We've got to pick a place with real food- I'm in a taco mood myself," Isaac answered cheerily, taking my paw and standing up. "Let's go get Luka! She's somewhere around here, I think."

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

By the time we found Luka and realized that none of us were actually ready for the interview, we agreed to tell Aeros at dinner that we needed a few days. 

So much for all of that excitement in the morning. Isaac seemed a little disappointed now, so I was determined to select the perfect restaurant. Not that this was actually a date.

"So," I suggested, "what about Mexican food? I'm sure there's got to be a good taco place somewhere."

"Oh," Luka replied, "I don't know. Maybe. We could try tacos. I mean, I don't eat a lot of meat, but I'm sure there'd be other options."

Isaac stared at me. 

"Simon," he said warningly. "Please don't make this about me. I don't care. You know that, right? It's fine. I need more time too. Besides, this isn't a date. This is just a friend thing!"

"Well," I said, trying to be as subtle as possible, "I'm in a taco mood."

Epic failure. Least subtle lion in the world. 

Luka shifted worriedly. "I'll do whatever," she said.

Isaac glanced back at her. "Hey... are you thinking about Kara?"

"Yeah," Luka muttered. "She really likes Mexican food. But, I mean, I don't care. Tacos are good. I just... I know that the wound was bad. She's not dead though, yeah? I just kind of... it felt like she was dead. I know she isn't. I got her an ambulance. Mr. Johnston didn't say or do anything, but... she got to the hospital. She lived."

"Hey," Isaac said softly, "She's still alive. She has to be. She got to the hospital. She's better by now, then."

"I haven't seen her in so long. So long that I just assumed she was... dead. But I called them that night, they s''aid'' she would live. And I need that to be true. I just drilled it into my mind that she died. If I could see her again..."

"So," I said, "Mexican food, then?"

"Sorry. It will get better, I know it. And I do want to talk about it. It just seems hard to... talk about that night. With a stranger," Luka said, quieting her voice.

"No, no," I said, "stupid response on my part. I'm bad at this. ''I'm'' sorry. 

"And you don't have to apologize for thinking about her. But what I mean to say is, she's better now. She probably ditched school after that. I doubt any of her family would've even let her come back, if she wanted too. 

"But she misses you, too. If she stands in front of you when faced by a gun-" I faltered, feeling like maybe I was saying the wrong thing, "then she loves you."

"Thanks," Luka murmured, "for everything."

"Plus, I'm sure Aeros is a nice guy! And he seemed pretty chill about scheduling. I think it'll be good. And we don't have to go to a Mexican restaurant. I mean, we could just--"

Luka smiled. Which probably meant I was talking too fast. The fact that she, smiled, though, was a total relief. I took a deep breath and smiled back. Then, I turned to Isaac.

"Oh my God, Simon, you're the best," he gushed, blushing as he grabbed my paws. "You seriously don't have to persuade everyone to get what I want. Actually. I just appreciate what you're doing. Being here. You don't need to do anything showy."

A new voice called- I turned, suddenly facing Aeros. "I'm up for Mexican food," he said, "but it's 6 o' clock, so if we want to go, we should go now."

I nodded hurriedly, hoping that this night would turn out well. Isaac got his favorite food, which was a bonus. Yes, I admit, I'd prefer fries and a milkshake, but tacos were still good. And so what if I was weak when it came to spices? I didn't need to put hot sauce on anything. 

Alright, so I didn't really want tacos. But this was going to work. 

Isaac swept in for a kiss, his arms looping around my back, pressing onto me, lips locked in mine, blushing his cheeks off as he stepped away, staggering, beaming.

"I think that you're the best," I added, leaning in for another incredible kiss. 

He was happy. I was happy, too. And if the sacrifice was making a joke out of myself for having a taco consisting only of beans, sour cream, cheese, and rice, then it would be worth it.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This was awkward. 

"I should tell you a little bit about myself," Aeros said, "so this doesn't feel so weird."

"Um. Yeah. Sure. Go ahead," I replied, attempting to be as polite as possible. 

God. 

This was a lot. My parents were going to see this. This would be on the news, these interviews. The petitions- we weren't alone at Mr. Johnston's school, we really weren't, but so many kids were afraid to speak up because of the kids like Teddy, which there weren't actually that many of-- 

I... this was a good change. A great change! I was excited. Just nervous, was all. Nervous about what other people would think. 

Which was stupid. Because this was ''good.'' I was telling myself that a hell of a lot of times, though. 

Was I comfortable being filmed and talking about all this? As if my experiences alone were the worst of all? Since they weren't the worst. They weren't. They were awful, but they weren't the worst. Still, I'm not really comfortable, since it was something completely new.

Yet again, my train of thought halted as I realized I was supposed to be engaging in conversation.

"So, I get that this must be weird for all of you. But you have no idea how much it means. Not that it matters much or anything, but yeah, I'm a trans guy, and growing up I didn't have a ton of support, and sometimes I got treated like s*** for it. Which was never OK. 

"And your stories, I know they're personal and not that great or that happy, but... they say something about society. They can prove society is wrong. ''You'' can prove that," Aeros finished, inhaling sharply.

"Well... we already agreed to the interviews, anyway," Isaac chimed in, "so I think we're already doing them."

Awkward pause. My gaze turns to Isaac. He's breathing heavily. Something's wrong.

"If I was in your position, I would've done anything to get out of that school."

"It's more than that," I said. "We do care. We care about this. We want things to be better, ''everywhere.'' It's worse than just this one summer school. We don't want it to be like that. 

"We want to be able to love who we love and that not mean anything bad or wrong. We just want to live. That's why we're here. 

"We understand what this whole interview movement thing is about. We want to be a part of it. We want to stand up for each other, we want our community to feel safe and understood. 

"But we have a right to care for our own happiness, too. We have a right to care about ourselves. We're going to work hard on this, we're going to make sure it's seen and heard and makes an impact, but we're not going to be able to change the world in a day. 

"We're going to try. I'm going to try, but I can't say it's all going to change. And I... I don't want my whole life to be sitting and being interviewed about all the f*****-up things that happened to me. 

"I want to be able to..." I pause, then turn to Isaac, and squeeze his paw, letting myself get lost in his eyes for a moment before turning back to Aeros... "I want to be able to have a boyfriend. I want to be able to go on a real date with him. I want to be able to love him and not be afraid, not feel guilty, not feel ''ashamed.'' 

"But I'm still going to try. I'm going to try for him, for me, for Luka... for the people that were scared, too. For the people that were too scared to say anything. This ''is'' important to me. 

"But queer joy should be allowed. Our lives should not be a constant fight for- for our lives. A struggle to be treated with respect. Queer joy shouldn't be the next step, an added bonus, it should be part of this. I'm going to spend some time living my life, not just fighting."

"S***, Simon," Aeros muttered, "that was incredible."

I took a deep breath. I was standing up, and some people at other tables were literally ''staring'' at me. Some stranger in the background let out a whoop-whoop and applauded. 

Before I could say or do anything, Isaac squeezed my paw back, even tighter, and smiled- and in an instant, we were kissing.

In front of all the people in a packed restaurant. 

We weren't hiding. Some people cheered? Some people looked away? It didn't matter, though, because this what I was talking about- ''this.'' Us. Getting to live our lives without fighting for once. Just being happy. 

My boyfriend was awesome. I loved him. Was now a good time to say that? Maybe not yet. But I wasn't quite as nervous about saying it. But I was mostly focused on kissing him, and how handsome and adorable he was. 

How he saw that beauty in me. No one had really... felt like that before. Or, well, general love. I mean, sure, it's not like Isaac's my adoptive father, 'cause that would be really weird and sort of creepy, but... 

No one has ever actually, like, complimented me. No one has ever really cared.

But I'm ready for this. I want to be Isaac Malcher's boyfriend, and pretty recently, he said he wanted to be mine, too. Which meant we were boyfriends. Oh, s***, wait, I hadn't actually ''said'' that. 

I pull away from him for a semi-awkward fifty seconds. 

"Isaac Malcher, I accept your request to be my boyfriend. Will you accept mine?"

"Obviously," he laughs, kissing me again, and again, and again. 

There are two other people at our table. Which I remember, then sit back down and flash a smile at Isaac. He grins back and sits back down, too. That was incredible. 

"Okay, great," Aeros said, "but it is kind of getting late, so once we finish up our food, you guys should head back to your hotel." 

"Congratulations, you two," Luka said, "though maybe try not to make out so much when we do our interviews."

"Yeah, yeah, I get it," I replied, rolling my eyes. 

I scooped a tortilla chip into some homemade guac, took a bite out of it, then pretty much claimed the entire bowl after realizing how delicious the guac was. And graciously let Isaac steal some chips. And, out of sympathy, allowed one each to Aeros and Luka, after they refuted my argument of them having ordered actual food. 

It was a good night. Maybe not perfect, but pretty damn good, anyway.

== 3. Talk ==


We had returned to our hotel room, it was around 8:30. The sun had set already and some stars settled into the sky. I mean, you only really see seven stars through the singular window in our room. Speaking of our room, it look like it had been hit by a miniature cyclone.

I honestly had ''not'' realized how much of a hurry Isaac and I were in this morning- like. It was a complete mess. 

The sheets on my bed were pulled halfway off the bed's left side. The previously neatly-arranged pastel pillows had been flung across the area, the smallest pillow was somehow under the bed completely. What had been my shoes lined up on a rack was toppled over, my favorite pair of sneakers now glued together by a puzzling knot.

The clean wooden floor  was half-covered in sweaters, jeans, hoodies, and basketball shorts that I probably should've packed up in boxes, and the closet Isaac and I were sharing had zero organization, all of the hangers were on the floor and the a few of the drawers within it were lying open- one of them had even fallen out.

"We should clean this up," Isaac commented. "I mean, mostly your side of the room is messy, but..."

"Hey!" I snapped, gesturing to Isaac's bed. "Look who's talking! You have a bunch of clothes on your bed!"

Then I realized that those were probably just pajamas he planned on wearing. 

"Well- well you should still help. It's your room too and clearly you didn't make any effort to be tidy and organized and calming earlier this morning," I responded, attempting to sound matter-of-factly, though clearly sounding flustered.

Isaac raised an eyebrow, looking in my direction. "You expect me to clean up after you now? We never agreed on that. How about we put all this silliness aside and we just leave it the way it is? We ought to be going to bed in an hour or so anyway."

Ugh. He's smart. I didn't want to clean up, so he's giving me what I want, while also winning an argument. Good on him. But, damnit on my part. 

"Alright, alright, you win," I stopped for a moment, then adjusted to face Isaac- "Uh, I kind of wanted to talk to you, actually."

Isaac glanced at me, he seemed genuinely confused. He didn't have to ask about what, since his expression already said it. I plopped down on my mess of a bed and tried to pull the sheets up to the corners so I wasn't just sitting on hard mattress. I always get kind of fidgety when I'm nervous, so I was especially desperate in trying to fix my sheets.

Isaac continued to stare. He wasn't really glowering, but it was definitely pressuring. Isaac was telling me to spit it out, and I regretted bringing it up already. I hadn't even actually brought it up yet. God.

"Well. I mean. Tonight."

From ridiculously unsubtle to ludicrously unclear. Not much of an improvement, really.

"What do you mean, Si?" Isaac quizzed me, "Did something happen tonight? Did you get hurt? Seriously, what's wrong?"

Si. I loved it when he called me that. It was absolutely adorable. 

Okay, okay, I need to focus. This is a serious question. I want to be able to inquire something and not actually sound like a total idiot for a change.

"I... you said you wanted to be my boyfriend. I do. I want to be your boyfriend. 

"But were you actually asking that? Do you really mean it? Or did you just want me to shut the hell up? Because I actually feel that way. I... I really care about you. And I don't know, I feel like something's changed. I mean, with the whole nickname thing. 

"Like, is that an evolution of our relationship? I just... I want to know your opinion. What's the status update here? And I'm being honest, as honest as I can- I really want us to be boyfriends. 

"I want to go out with you. I... really like you. I don't mean to pressure you at all, which I know I absolutely am right now, but God, this question has been messing with me.

"I'm so sorry. It's just super unclear how you feel sometimes, and it's kind of aggravating when I want to know but you're not actually upfront about it.

" I- sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought this up, it's so stupid, we've only been together for like a month and a half- obviously you don't feel that way. I'm rushing things, when I shouldn't be. Let's just pretend I never said any of this, yeah? That's a great idea, thanks for the input, Iz."

Isaac sat down on his bed, opposite me, looking absolutely flabbergasted. Good news? He probably hadn't heard half of what I said. Bad news? He heard at least half of what I said. 

And I'm not exactly the best at math, but I know what percentages are. Meaning, 50% chance Isaac heard the accidental nickname drop, the let's-forget-this-whole-really-dumb-move-I-made part, the are-you-serious-or-are-you-kidding-me part, like, to the point where I was basically exploding. 

No, scratch that, I exploded. I was smoke, ashes, and flaming garbage.

"You... you called me Iz," he stated shyly. 

"Um. Maybe," I answered anxiously. 

"And... and you want to be my boyfriend. And I asked you to be my boyfriend. And you think I'm not your boyfriend?" He questioned, tilting his head to the right.

"I-- well- because, since, at the time I was sort of freaking out about you breaking up with me, because you're the first person that I guess has like, liked me back, but I was super unsure and kind of have a lot of self-doubt and major, er, I honestly don't know but yeah my parents are kind of completely homophobic so have never supported me. 

I inhaled and exhaled. Breathe in, breathe out. Again. Isaac was completely silent. Absolutely baffled. Which I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I really didn't want to find out, so I just let all of it out. Well, most of it, anyway.

"And well they basically made me feel like no one could ever love me so yeah I just kind of thought you know they're probably right and I've been so nervous about this whole boyfriend idea because you know all these voices in my head keep on saying you probably hate me or you're in this for a laugh or something--"

"Si. Si, stop. Please stop. I really care about you, okay? I really do," Isaac croaked, "I really like you too. Because you're awesome. And I don't care if you're not a math genius or whatever the hell it is you're so stressed about. But I do want to be your boyfriend. And I was hoping for some one-on-one time tonight, but you know, I assumed you'd get the memo based on my reaction..."

"God. Sorry for ruining your night," I uttered, tears streaking down my cheeks. I really was sorry, and I wanted him to think that I wasn't a total wrecking ball of a lion, that, you know, I was somebody worth something.

"No, no, shh. You didn't do that. We literally made out. I wouldn't call that ruining my night, Si. I ''like'' kissing you. I would initiate it every day if possible. You did not ruin my night, ''at all.'' As a matter of fact, you made it way better than my nights usually go," Isaac blurted passionately. "Simon, if we're not boyfriends in your head, then I should make sure that happens. Because I really want you to call me your boyfriend."

"All you ate tonight was chips and guacamole! No wonder you're like this. Simon, you need sustenance. Real food. Come on, we're going to go out on a real date," Isaac commanded, grabbing my quivering shoulders and pulling me up, practically dragging me out the door.

"Wh- what are you- I- I'm trying to apologize, a-and you're saying I didn't do anything? But... But I thought that..." I sniffed, wiping my eyes of tears. 

"Simon, please. We're going to get you what you want, I swear. Pull yourself together. We're gonna go to that place- Patty's or something, the fast food restaurant you were so excited about," Isaac explained, forcing me down the hallway and into the lobby. 

Out the door. Outside. There were stars, shining, piercing. The moon was up, a big, yellow sphere, kind of like a smiley face. Maybe the universe was telling me that tonight was going to stay a good night.

I guess I don't really know why I get like this sometimes. Everything was going great. I'm just ironically a massively insecure lion. I suppose I've never been a fan of stereotypes, nor do any describe me all that well.

Then, I saw a new bright thing- the classical diner-like cursive of the neon-lights Patty's sign. One of my favorite burger joints in all of Jamaa. I mean, there could've been a better one, but Patty's was my go-to hangout place. And Isaac had taken me there. 

"Here we are. The castle of deep-fried sodium and blended sugar," Isaac announced, gently grazing the tips of my claws, lacing his own through mine, slowly and carefully. "My treat," he added, "I brought some cash.'

"It's... it's almost nine," I said dazedly, "H... how?" 

"Magic, my beloved boyfriend. I'm secretly a wizard," Isaac responded teasingly. 

"Boyfriend," I whispered, "sounds good."

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Isaac sat opposite from me in the bright pink-cotton candy cushioned benches of Patty's, where I leaned over the silvery square table to read the menu upside-down. I could not read things upside-down.

Upon noticing my failed attempt, Isaac grinned. "You want the menu, don't you?" He inquired flirtatiously.

"I have to choose my milkshake flavor," I replied solemnly. 

"I thought we were sharing one," he shot back with a mischievous smile.

"You remembered what I said," I murmured dazedly, "you really are a wizard."

"Do you like chocolate?" He added curiously.

"Not more than you," I muttered stupidly.

Oh, f***. 

Isaac's cheeks were tomato red. Mine were blood red, if that was even possible, and if it wasn't, then it was then. 

"Excuse me," a waitress asked politely, arriving at our table swiftly, "what will you be having tonight?"

"Um. One medium chocolate milkshake, please," I said. "And, uh, a Coke and a lemonade."

"What about food?" The waitress continued, somewhat impatiently.

I basked in an awkward silence, trying to recall the specifics of my usual. Thankfully, another voice prompted me to not seem like a complete idiot- Isaac's. He knew my favorite burger. On that note, I broke into a grin.

"Two cheeseburgers, please- one with pepper jack, pickles, onions, tomatoes, lettuce- ketchup and mustard, no mayonnaise. The other with white cheddar, bacon, pickles, onions, and mayonnaise. And a large side of fries," Isaac answered hastily. 

The waitress nodded, then hurriedly walked away to another table. I was officially in an exhausted stupor. Isaac was doing something unbelievably kind and romantic, and I was too dumb and sleepy to do anything in return. I'd known he was out of my league, but not that out of my league. 

"I hope I remembered it right," Isaac said shyly, "you weren't answering, so I just assumed it was OK for me to finish the order."

"No, it's fine," I answered quickly, "you did the right thing. Thanks for this. All of it. It's really just amazing of you."

"Oh, well, you know, I just... I just thought that I ought to show you I really care," Isaac responded softly, "you seemed really nervous earlier."

"It wasn't your fault, Isaac. We just haven't had enough time to talk things through," I replied reassuringly, but to me, that was a fact, not just something to make him feel better.

"About that, I... There's something I should tell you. It might, er, change how you feel about me. I mean, not a lot, just, when we decide we're serious about this..." Isaac answered nervously.

"It won't, Isaac. Nothing could do anything other than make us even closer and even stronger," I breathed heavily, inhaling confidence, exhaling doubt- I had never been so sure in my life.

"Well, this is different. It's about me. I- Luka already knows this, it was just- it was easier to tell her, alright?  I mean- not that I didn't think you- not that I think you would take it... badly. I just..."

Wait, what? What was so important that he skipped over me to tell someone else? Even if that someone was Luka, we were more than friends. Luka was just a friend. Luka was important, too, but not- not for Isaac. Isaac and I are supposed to be a ''we,'' an ''us,'' not separated by some stupid secret. Or was I just not important enough? 

"Isaac, what the hell? Did you just take me here to butter me up or something?" I couldn't help it. Looking back, I knew it was the sh****est reaction possible. I had let all of that insecurity and frustration and confusion come flooding back. I should've been patient, should've been kind, should've been welcoming, should've been gentle. 

When it came to the important parts, I was none of those things. 

"Okay then. I kind of actually thought you were chill with this stuff. Especially when you went to help Luka! Well, surprise-surprise, Simon, the big, horrible, f***ed-up secret is that I'm trans."

S***, I sounded like my parents. 

And f*** the fact that I was quiet after Isaac came out to me. 

And just to make sure that I had really made our entire night a complete f***ing s***show, I didn't get up out of my seat after Isaac left a check on the table and ran out of the restaurant in tears. 

S***, Isaac was crying, and I wasn't by his side. 

The worst part was that Isaac and I probably weren't a ''we'' anymore. Scratch that. The worst part was that I made my boyfriend think I don't love him because of who he is. 

S***, I had to tell Isaac I loved him.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Thank Zios I had brought my phone with me, otherwise I might've died. First, I tried to text Isaac- rookie mistake. 

''Look, Iz, I'm really sorry, that was super crappy of me. Can we please talk?'' 

Isaac's reply: ''Please leave me the hell alone.'' 

I felt horrible. I had made a scene in a restaurant at 9 P.M. and probably looked like I was on a drunken rampage. I had pushed away the jammer I was closest to, and pretty much made him think I was a raging transphobe. And holy Mira, by then he had probably told Luka all about it- so not only that, but I had pushed away my one and only friend. 

Also, my ride back to the hotel was gone. Which I damn well deserved. 

After leaving the most generous tip I could, I tried calling Luka outside. They didn't pick up. I tried to shoot Luka a text, but I wasn't sure how to put my feelings to words. I scrolled desperately through my contacts- Who else could I turn to?

Aeros. The name struck me like lightning. With haste, I typed up a message and pressed send. Not long after, Aeros replied, filling me with relief. 

''I'll be there in 15. Isaac there too?'' 

The question at the end proceeded to fill me with dread. I couldn't lie and say Isaac was there, because it would be obvious that he wasn't.

''No,'' I typed back, ''I'll explain later.'' 

I took a deep breath. Aeros' reporter's instinct would kick in, and I would be dead. Giving half the truth to a budding journalist would be like cooking bacon in front of a dog: The dog is going to want the bacon. You give the dog a crumb, it wants a whole piece.

I didn't initially recognize Aeros' car, but the blue polar bear was fairly recognizable on his own. He pulled down the window and told me to come in. Before I said anything else, I found myself blurting out a random question.

"What is it like to be trans?"

Aeros raised an eyebrow. Immediately, I bit my lip, thinking the question was a bad one. But, soon enough, Aeros provided me with a thoughtful. and quite elaborate, reply. 

"I like being trans," he said wistfully, "it's a part of me that I don't want to change. The only thing I would change is being born in the body that's right for me. There's only so much I can do with the one that I have. 

" Of course, things are different now- better than they were before. But being trans is still hard. Lots of people don't understand it, and they judge and ignore and fear what they don't understand.

"So a lot of times, my identity is overlooked. People have refused to use my name and pronouns. For example, my grandparents know me as a girl. They love me, but they only love me as a girl. And I'm not a girl. The unfortunate truth is because they can't see past my gender assigned at birth, they can't see me. 

"Every newspaper I've worked for, I made sure I was listed as a male writer. But my grandparents don't want to see any of my accomplishments as Aeros. They want me to 'embrace my womanhood.'

"My grandmother is a feminist. She believes that I'm rejecting my female body because women don't have rights. She believes that by doing this, I'm a misogynist. Which isn't true. Just like any other boy, I can still be a feminist- and I am a feminist. I'm just not a girl. 

"In my personal experience, most cis people make comments like this unintentionally- they don't have a clear concept of what being trans is, so they make it up in their heads. Obviously, that doesn't automatically mean they're transphobic, it just means they're confused.

"A lot of times people accidentally misgender me. They look at my chest and my curves and decide that I am a woman. These assumptions about gender and pronouns aren't a good habit. It takes a lot of energy to educate people about why they shouldn't assume those things, though. Almost every day, I have to explain myself. 

"Sometimes, I'm rejected. Sometimes, I'm ignored. I dislike being ignored the most. If people deny me, then at least I know not to bother with them- since I now realize that people who can't love me for who I am can't love me at all. If they accept me, it shows me that they are someone I can respect and maybe trust as a friend or something more. 

"Immediate acceptance is what validates me, what fulfills me. For most cis people, it takes them work and practice to get my pronouns right. Being around other gender-nonconforming and trans people is like magic. It's instant acceptance, instant love, instant understanding. I wish that cis people could provide that same feeling. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case.

"But it's harder for nonbinary people and people who use neopronouns. Those concepts are very new to society, no matter how long people have felt that way. To be honest, I like using the singular they/them. I'm demiboy.

"Obviously, my gender identity isn't a secret. It's just a fact, something I share about myself. I hope that one day, it can really just be a fact- I can walk up to someone, say I'm trans and demiboy, and it won't matter. I won't be shoving it down their throats or making up some silly fantasy. I'll just be me.

"Dysphoria is an issue that can't really be solved, unfortunately. I had a lot of dysphoria as I went through puberty. I hated all of the changes happening to my body. I cut my hair short and wore baggy clothes and tried out for the boys' sports teams, but all that did was make things worse. I was teased through most of middle school. There was no education about gender or pronouns or being queer in middle school.

"And I think that there should have been. The root of discrimination is I am one thing and you are this, I am one thing that these other people are and you are different, I am normal and you are weird. The truth is "normal" is different for everyone, so it really is just silly that "weirdness" exists. 

"Around 8th Grade, my older sibling came out as nonbinary. Because I had no education about gender, like my peers, I didn't know there were other options. My older sibling coming out to me opened a thousand doors for me. I started researching online about different gender identities, and the first thing I found out about sounded a lot like me.

"That's how I found out I was trans. But I didn't know what I was supposed to do after that. I remember being so excited, though, saying it over and over again in the mirror. My sibling found me and smiled, and started talking to me about things I could do- binders, puberty blockers, buying boys' clothes, even testosterone shots. 

"After coming out to my parents, who did their best to support me, I decided to start small. I brought a couple of masculine outfits and got an actual haircut. I enjoyed dressing like a boy and expressing myself as one. I wasn't playing pretend, though- this was reality. And I was happy. 

"In my freshman year of high school, I got a binder as a Hannukah present. I was overjoyed- it fit perfectly, and it felt amazing. Then, though, I started feeling more discomfort whenever I didn't have my binder on. I didn't want anyone taking pictures of me without it on. I was frustrated when I realized I couldn't wear it to sleep.

"Eventually, I got a therapist. The best part was, he was a trans man too- he knew what I was going through. He was one of the first trans adults that I met in real life. 

"He showed me I had a future, and that my transness wasn't something that would hold me back, it was something that would lift me up. After talking to him, I came up with ways to be comfortable in a binder while being safe. 

"Later, in my junior year, I realized I was bisexual. I had a crush on a girl, and she liked me back, so we made it official. It was my first relationship with a girl.

"But, she was cis, and I was trans... so it was a bit of a process to get her to understand that I didn't have traditionally male body parts. By then, I had gotten top surgery as well.  We had a few rough patches, but she apologized, she supported me, she gave me space when I needed it and most of all she gave me joy. 

"...And, well, it worked out. Now, I'm engaged to the same girl, who loves not just my transness, but me. And I love her. To me, it's not just her love, but the love that my friends give me, that my family give me, the love I feel at every pride event that lifts me up the most. My journey to transition was also my journey of learning to love myself. And I succeeded.

"It's why I'm a writer, too. There are lots of trans and gender-nonconforming people who don't have the luck or the joy that I do. And that shouldn't be the case. There are people who need to know they're not alone. And that's what my writing can do. Frankly, Simon, that's why I was so eager to tell your story, to tell Luka's story, to tell Isaac's story. Because people need to hear it."

I exhaled sharply. I hadn't realized that I'd been holding my breath the whole time. How could Aeros speak like that? My heart was beating quickly. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I had no idea how much hurt Isaac could've gone through. And how my silence hurt him, too.

How my silence hurt the world.

"Holy s***, Aeros," I whispered gratefully, "you're incredible."

"We're there, in case you were wondering," Aeros said. 

He paused. 

"And Simon? Thank you for asking. Not every cis person is willing to listen. Isaac is lucky to have you."

Isaac told Aeros he was trans because I wasn't trans, and we can't relate to each other about that topic. But I wasn't supporting Isaac to the fullest. I had to think of what I could do. 

Of course. A Hannukah present.

== 4. Sky ==
''"All we see is sky, for forever. We let the world pass by, for forever. Feels like we could be alright, for forever, this way." -''Dear Evan Hansen 

I found Isaac sitting on the balcony, alone. It was a cool night with a pleasant breeze, one of those midsummer nights that make you feel like anything is possible. Even healing scars. 

Isaac was listening to music. He had his earbuds in, and he wasn't smiling, but he was tapping his paw to the beat, singing softly. I never knew that Isaac liked singing. 

I felt uncertain, awkward. It had been the same way when I first kissed Isaac. Clumsy, scared, vulnerable. I had messed up this time, though. But Isaac didn't owe me forgiveness. He had a right to be upset. An apology seemed like the wrong thing to do, but the right thing. In elementary school, an apology was enough. 

But this was real life, and sometimes feelings were so big that you couldn't just bottle them up and put them away. Sometimes, feelings were big enough that they never went away, they would only shrink as time went on. Slowly, things would get better. 

That's when I realized there wasn't anything I could do in the moment. Isaac wanted to be alone, listening to music, soaking in the night where everything felt possible. Without me. Because people need space, and people need time. I hurt Isaac's feelings, and I can't just say that I'm sorry, I have to show that I'm sorry.

I walked back into our hotel room. I lay down in bed and played ''All I Want For Christmas Is You'' by Mariah Carey, and since I couldn't sing, I hummed the parts that I knew. I didn't have headphones or earbuds, but it didn't really matter, since Isaac did, so Isaac wouldn't hear anything. 

When the song ended, I listened to the crickets chirp and the frogs croak. But they were all just the background music, all playing along to Isaac's beautiful voice. I cried a little, then curled up in a ball on my own, and thought of when Isaac and I talked to Luka for the first time, and how that time was when Luka was having suicidal thoughts. 

Isaac didn't know what to say, and so instead, he listened to my heartbeat, leaning into my chest deeper than I thought was possible. He wasn't ready to walk into that room. He was still reliving his dysphoria, I should've been able to notice all the hints. But even then, Isaac was still by my side, holding onto me as I held onto him. 

For the rest of the night, Isaac stayed outside on the balcony, singing. I stayed inside, listening to the varying Mariah Carey songs that played on my phone. I thought of all the things Isaac had done for me, and I thought of all the things I wanted to do for him. 

There were eight stars I could see through the window that night. The brightest one was Isaac. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Somewhere between the last blinking of stars and the first glimpse of sunlight, Isaac had come back inside. Utterly sleep-deprived, I fumbled around the room until I found the coffee pot. I grabbed a mug and let the bitter, energizing drink come out in waves. Isaac must have already heated it up. 

Isaac. A part of me was desperate to see him behind me, trapping me in a passionate hug within seconds. But he wasn't there. His bed was pushed a few feet further from mine. The balcony door was shut, and Isaac wasn't outside. He had already left the room. 

It was too early for a Hannukah present. I crossed the idea off my list of things to do to make it up to Isaac. Another sip of coffee, without a trace of cream or sugar. I focused on the taste of the liquid blackness, as if I was eating my words. 

I had stayed up all night listening to music and making the list. The Hannukah present seemed genius to me, but of course it was stupid, because at the rate I'd gone, Isaac and I wouldn't be a couple by the start of the holidays. Not to mention the fact that it was still summer.  

I made a terrible mistake, and now Isaac wanted nothing to do with me. And I wanted him so, so, badly, it was as if there was a rope attached to my chest, pulling me to him, and he was sawing it off, little by little. 

Cutting me, little by little. And each drop of blood hit the floor and made a noise like thunder. This was my fault, and I had to fix it.

Another sip of coffee. I could try to find Luka, but I had a feeling they wouldn't be willing to hear me out. Isaac would've already told Luka.  And I couldn't trouble them, not when they were already going through so much. 

And Mira, what might Isaac have gone through in his first year? I should've asked. I should've been there. I should've said something. I should've done something. 

I never stopped to think that Isaac needed something other than hugs and kisses and dates. I thought that was all there was. But love was more complex. ''Life'' was more complex. 

Memories filled my head, buzzing, stinging, bursting, screaming. I couldn't keep them down anymore. Isaac, trapped in the locker room, smudged with makeup and stuffed into a dress. He must've felt horrible. My fists clenched just at the thought of Teddy Arruga, his cold, cruel smile and hollow laugh. 

The calls of ''f****t, homo, sissy, queer, t****y,'' every single horrid word clawing at me at the same time, every single thing that was so damn wrong with the world that I hadn't done a thing about. So many people around the world were struggling, so many people needed help and support and love, and Isaac was one of those people, but I hadn't given him what he needed. 

I was in my little bubble, cis and gay and neurotypical, minding my own business. 

But I could at least believe in myself. I could at least trust myself. 

How could Isaac live when his body was his prison?

I realized I was panting, and I'd ripped the list apart. None of my ideas would matter anymore. I would have to face my problems and talk to Isaac. It was the right thing to do. 

Then again, there was always Aeros. He had been honest and kind when he didn't have to be. Maybe he would be willing to talk to me. 

I didn't know what to say to Isaac. I didn't know how to tell him I loved him, because Zios, I hadn't kissed a soul before Isaac, hadn't whispered my heart out in the dead of night or stared into someone's eyes while they stared back or danced with someone until morning came. 

I was sure that was something I had to do with a girl, so I was sure that I just hadn't found the right person yet.

I had done every one of those things with Isaac, and nothing had ever felt more right.

But I did something wrong, so what was I supposed to do to make it right again?

I took a deep breath and shot Aeros a text. I sent it, and prayed he would answer.

Me: ''Sorry to bother u, but i made a huge mistake and Isaac is mad at me. Can we talk?''

In the nick of time, Aeros responded. I was shocked that he was even up so early. I barely knew him at all, but he jumped to my side whenever I asked.  

Aeros'': This has something to do with the fact that he wasn't there last night, doesn't it?''

It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but it didn't seem reasonable for me to expect much else. Aeros was still a journalist. Aeros was doing his job. The night before, though, he told me that he needed my story, Luka's story, and Isaac's story to be heard. Not because of his job, though.

Me: ''Yeah. He came out to me and I kinda just stared at him. I wasn't sure what to say. Now he's upset and sad and he thinks I hate him. It's really bad. I messed up. He won't talk to me and won't spend time with me. I don't know how to show him I'm sorry.'' 

Aeros: ''It's barely even morning. Have you tried talking to him yet today?''

Of course. That was perfectly logical. How come I hadn't just texted him when I woke up? My text back answered the question more accurately than I would've been able to say out loud.

Me:  ''I just don't know what I would say. I don't know where he is, either. He wasn't here when I woke up, and he still isn't.''

Aeros: ''Maybe you don't need to say anything.'' 

What the hell was that supposed to mean? 

Me: ''I can't just walk up to him.'' 

Aeros: ''I meant you could write him a note. Maybe sing him a song, write him a poem, a love letter, something like that. I've always thought writing is easier than talking.'' 

I changed the subject. I didn't want to admit that I was s*** at writing ''and'' singing. 

Me: ''You sounded like you had rehearsed a scene straight from Broadway when you told me what being trans meant to you. Your writing must be great.'' 

Aeros: ''I meant like banter. I could go on and on about things I'm passionate about for hours. I can barely strike up a normal conversation. Did you completely forget the dinner we had? I was stuttering in every sentence.''

Me: ''Well, I  was mostly making out with Isaac...''

Aeros: ''I'm serious. Just write him something and put it on his bedside table, or a place you'll know he'll find it. You clearly love him.'' 

Me: ''What am I supposed to write about? There are a million things I could write about. Isaac is perfect. He's beautiful.'' 

Aeros: ''Write about the million things. If I write a love letter for you, it won't be the same. It won't be yours. Besides, I wouldn't do that.'' 

Aeros: ''The fact that you're obsessing this much at 5 AM is a good example, too.'' 

Me: ''I'm not obsessing! OK, fine, I want to tell him I love him. I've wanted to ever since we got here. Then I became the world's biggest idiot for one minute, and ruined our entire relationship. Because I was scared and stupid and slow.'' 

Aeros: ''The longer you don't say or do anything, the less likely it is that Isaac will be willing to give it another shot.'' 

Me: ''What if he thinks the note is cheesy, or stupid, or bad, or some sort of sick joke?''

Aeros: ''I don't think he will. About the time thing, though, maybe don't bother him this early.''

Me: ''He's awake. He has to be. He can't be asleep and not in our room.''

Aeros: ''Well, then, take advantage of that. Set something up in the room for when he comes back. He has to eventually.'' 

Genius. Aeros was a genius. I ended our chat with a quick thank you, and immediately got to work (also while spilling coffee all over myself). 

It was time to write the cheesiest love song in the world.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I didn't know if it was good or not. I just thought about life, and thought about Isaac, and wrote something. How I felt when I was with him. I wanted to make sure he ''knew''. Not just that I thought he was amazing (because he is), but how I ''felt.'' I ''did'' love him. And I wasn't ashamed of it. I didn't want him to be ashamed, either.

And then I realized it kind of rhymed. So maybe it was a song. 

And I couldn't sing.

But I could always try.

So I started practicing, right then and there. I croaked out the first verse. It sounded like absolute s***.

But the words sounded right.

How was I supposed to make them sound ''good,'' though?


'''''Angel Arms'' - For Isaac, From Simon'''

''Hold me a little closer, love,'' 

''Your eyes are the stars,'' 

''Each other a blanket,'' 

''So hold me a little closer, love,'' 

''With your angel arms...''



And it was right. It was true. It was perfect. 

The door opened. My ears perked up. Was Isaac really back?

"F***," a voice muttered under their breath, "this was a s***** idea."

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"F***!" I yelled, a shot of adrenaline spiking through my veins. "Wh- what are you doing here!?"

"Okay, I now realize I'm interrupting something," said the voice, now much more clearly, "but Isaac asked me to come up here. He's still upset, by the way. It might've helped if you actually apologized."

Luka. With a reasonable sarcastic edge to their voice. Yeah, I had messed up. But I was trying, ''really'' trying to fix it. 

"And this room is an absolute s***show. What the hell are you doing, Simon?" Luka inquired, genuinely disgusted by the mess I'd made.

I chose to ignore the insult to my cleanliness, despite its accuracy. That wasn't the real problem. 

"I know I messed up, alright? I just- I thought I could make it up to Isaac. You were right, Luka. I need to put myself out there. It's only fair. Isaac did, so I--"

"Oh, f*** that. Simon, look, it's great that you're being responsible here, but please don't be dumb. Isaac ''came out to you'', and you ''looked at him like he was crazy''. You can't sugarcoat that. As someone who's trans, that's just a crappy reaction. You need to tell him, with your words, out loud, that you accept him. And he doesn't hate ''you'', he thinks you hate ''him''."

I swallowed hard. Again, Luka was right. But I didn't want to scrap what I'd written. I wished so hard that I'd be able to sing my song to Isaac, assuming I'd managed to fix this mistake. A song wasn't the answer. I had to be direct. That was what Isaac had needed.

Because I ''do'' care about him being trans. I love him, ''every single part'' of him. That includes his being trans.

And that's where I'd really made the mistake. I didn't need to prove I was so in love with him that nothing could possibly change it. I needed to prove that I loved him for who he was, and who he was only made me love him more.

"Please," I breathed heavily, "tell me where Isaac is."

Luka narrowed their eyes once more. "He's ''your'' boyfriend. Where do ''you'' think he is?"

Damnit. Luka was really good at being right. 

If Isaac wasn't ready to be up close with me as soon as he woke up, then he'd go to wherever he could get some peace and quiet that wasn't our balcony. The courtyard.

My ah-ha moment was pretty obvious. Instantly, Luka smirked. I was relieved that they weren't permanently p***ed at me. 

But I didn't really bother with expressing that relief. Luka had probably already read my mind. I had more pressing matters at the time: a beautiful, talented, charming, and increasingly wonderful transgender prince to apologize to (and also hopefully make out with. And maybe, if I'm feeling extra bold, ask him out).

I exited the lobby in a breeze. Before scanning for Isaac officially, I took a moment to, well, take things in: how ''possible'' the open, blue sky made things feel. No wonder Isaac liked it out there. The splendid weather only made me more confident that Isaac was here.

And there he was, sitting on a stone bench, singing ''All I Want For Christmas Is You''.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I took a step forward. I paused. I lost my breath for almost an entire minute: Isaac ''had'' heard me. But I hadn't shown that I'd heard him.

His voice echoed across the courtyard, unforgivingly beautiful. He effortlessly reached the song's climax, belting out "All I want for Christmass... is you!" so meaningfully that I broke into tears.

And we both started crying. And some part of him knew I was there, jaws dropped. And he turned around. And I kept sobbing. And I hugged him so, so tightly. And I whispered into his ear, ''I love you, Isaac''. ''I love every part of you.'' 

The quiet was so strong that I didn't even mind when clouds thickened and grayed, a storm brewing. I still didn't mind when rain pitter-pattered down my back. I still didn't mind when the wind started howling.

"Thank you," he murmured shyly. "I love you, too."

¨I´m glad you do,¨ I whispered honestly, ¨and I´m sorry I wasn´t there for you when I should´ve been.¨

¨Simon?¨ Isaac questioned softly. 

¨Yeah?¨ I answered breathlessly.

¨I wanted you to know that Aeros talked to me. About what you asked him. The night I came out to you. And it means a lot to me that you cared. That you understood.¨

¨I ''do'' care,¨ I smiled back. ¨I care a lot, Iz.¨

¨You called me Iz again,¨ Isaac said wistfully, ¨I kind of like it.¨

¨That´s good,¨ I replied happily.

¨This is kind of crazy. It´s been a month and a half. Not really a long time, huh?¨ Isaac asked in a low voice.

¨Yeah. But I want to keep going. I like what we´re doing. I like being your boyfriend,¨ I answered, still beaming.

¨I do too.¨

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;

And I looked up, and all I saw was infinite gray, endless sky, hopeless storm clouds.

But Isaac was the sun, shining through all the dreariness, slicing through the darkness like it was butter.

And I melted into his arms, which really did feel like an angel's, because Zios, he absolutely looked like one. 

And Isaac was the best summer ever.

And he took all my breath away and so passionately refused to give it back, and within a matter of seconds I was a boy kissing an angel, we were two boys kissing each other, and the world fell away, and the rest was light.

My paws slid into his and we sat together on the stone bench in the courtyard. His fur was moist but I didn't mind since mine was too. I leaned into him like he was as endless as the sky, I fell into the music of his heartbeat, and I kissed him again and it lasted a decade, and it was beautiful.

"I accept you, Isaac, every part of you. You are the most incredible person I have ever met. I want to spend every day of this summer with you. You're the nerdiest, cutest, most talented, and most beautiful coyote in all of existence. I'm honored that you're my boyfriend."

"You sound like such a geek," Isaac whispered, and if it was possible for the world to break apart even further, it did, and it was wonderful. 

"Your wizardry is contagious," I replied, overwhelmed with joy, so ''alive'' that I felt like I had woken up for the first time in a thousand years.

"We can be ourselves now, Simon. We can do this every day. We can help other people get to this point in their lives," Isaac gushed wholeheartedly.

"Nearly all of Jamaa is going to hear our story tomorrow. Just think of it. We won't be hidden anymore," he added dreamily, his eyes lit up with stars, entire constellations, a universe of feelings, some foreign, that all I wanted to do with was to dig into, to know, to be close to.

But...

The world came back.

I sat up straight. My paws went slack in Isaac's.

"My parents might see," I said, knowing I was ruining the moment, that I could've stayed and explored Isaac's universe as he explored mine.

"You haven't talked about them much," Isaac muttered uncertainly, "are they... not supportive?"

"No. No, not really. But... I don't think they'd love me even if I was straight. I was never good enough for them," I murmured, "I just... they made me feel like- the things they did ''still'' make me feel like a screw-up, like I'm just stupid and useless and pathetic. I guess that's why... I guess that's why I was so scared you hated me."

"Simon," Isaac said softly, leaning into my ear, staring me dead in the eye, pouring his universe into mine, "It isn't possible for me to hate you."

"I... I think something's wrong with me," I whispered, tears wetting my cheeks, "I tried to be strong, Iz. I really did. But I'm terrified of what my parents will think. What if... What if they get interviewed too? What will people think about me then?"

"They'll admire you for being an upstander. They'll consider you a role model. You'll change their lives for the better," Isaac promised, then firmly gripping my paw, filling me with confidence, with love.

"Like you changed Luka's," he added sincerely, "and like you changed mine."

"After this summer, I might never see you again. What happens then? What am I supposed to do?" I questioned shakily.

Isaac paused for a minute. I could tell he was holding back tears now.

"You'll fall," he said softly, "but you might just fall back into my arms."

"Worst comes to worst, you'll find someone else who loves you just as much, no matter how impossible I think it is," he finished tightly.

"You should love yourself, though, Simon."

And I looked back up at the sky. And it was around seven in the morning and the sun was rising.

And there was pink for our love, red for our fear, orange for our worries, yellow for our joy.

Yet the most prominent colors were pink and yellow.

And so I let the sky, the sun made by Zios, the moon made by Mira, send me a sign.

"After the interviews, I'm going to take you out. I want to make sure we have one last summer day together. Before we might have more," I concluded devotedly.

== 5. Tears ==


Isaac and I had managed to stumble back into the hotel room. I was still processing it all, how chaotic these last few days had been, wondering what Isaac thought, how he felt.

"...Simon?" Isaac murmured uncertainly, suddenly shifting away from me. 

"Yeah?" I asked back, faux-casually tilting my head, instinctively taking a step closer. 

"I, uh, I'm sorry. I should've given you more time when I... When I told you. I just... I was scared. I don't know, you just looked kind of shocked, and I didn't know how to feel, and I just..."

"No, no, I should've been clear with you. It's not your fault. You shouldn't apologize. It's ''your'' coming out, not mine," I answered insistently, hoping so strongly that Isaac wasn't mad at himself.

"I know we already talked about it, but I wanted to-- I wanted to make that clear. I've just, um, had some bad experiences in the past with... Well, um, other- other people."

"What?" I turned again, eyebrows raised- ''Other people? What other people?''

"I mean- You're not the first person I've dated. That's all."

"Oh," I responded emptily, the color draining from my face. How was I supposed to react to that? Isaac was ''my'' first. I just assumed that... That, well, he and I were both... had both not dated other people.

"Not that- I'm- I'm not in contact with my exes. They were all kind of a**holes, to be honest. I mean- one of them was literally from eighth grade, and we just like kissed a few times and held hands, and never spoke to each other again since we went to different high schools, and-"

I swallowed hard, opening my mouth a little, trying to find words-- Of course I didn't think he was cheating on me, it just... It made me feel kind of bad. Like I was inexperienced or something.

"No, uh, I- I believe you," I interjected awkwardly, "I'd actually, er, prefer not to hear any... details."

"S***, that's not what I meant. I- I swear that--"

I stopped for a moment. Clearly, Isaac was intimidated. I wished I could make myself smaller, maybe then he would be less scared of me. I kind of hated being tall. 

"Are you... Are you alright?"

"Fine," Isaac sniffed, "all good." But he obviously wasn't. He was shivering in place, and tears streaked his face. His eyes were red, and they hadn't been before, and his paws were trembling-- I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what was wrong, just that something was definitely wrong, ''very'' wrong.

I grabbed him, pulling him into my chest. I wrapped him in a tight hug and didn't let him go. I wasn't sure what else I could do other than just be there.

"Hey," I murmured softly, "you're here. You're with me right now. You're safe."

"I- I-" Isaac stammered, shaking uncontrollably then, and I still didn't know what to do to make him feel better, but I wanted to do that so, so badly. His voice broke into sobs and it was like he was choking on his tears. His breaths grew wheezy and his eyes were wide and I still didn't know what to do.

I held onto him even tighter and tried to lift him up off of the ground. I could barely even manage that, it was like he had somehow gotten heavier. Frantically, I let my eyes dart around, looking for help-- And there was Luka.

"Luka! Luka, Isaac is-- something's wrong!" I shouted desperately, scrambling to reach them.

I kept Isaac in my arms, terrified of dropping him. He was still tense, and I could feel his forehead get hotter, dripping with sweat-- I was worried. Really worried.

Luka put down their phone almost immediately, bounding towards us with a determined speed. "What's going on? Are you guys okay?"

"He- he's-- I don't know what's happening to him," I choked out, "he seemed fine, and then things got kind of awkward, he mentioned dating other people, I didn't know about it so I felt kinda weird, then- then he just started freaking out all of a sudden and I- I tried to help him, asked him if he was okay, he just-- he started crying and shaking and I--" 

"Simon. Simon, take a breath. Put him down. I- I think he's having a panic attack," Luka responded firmly, clutching our intertwined paws.

"R- right," I muttered, carefully placing an increasingly wheezy Isaac onto the ground. "I- um- what does that mean?" I whispered questioningly.

"Something probably triggered it while you were talking. He's going to be alright. We just have to make sure he doesn't hurt himself and help him calm down."

Calm. How was Luka so collected? I was already a hot mess of anxious sweat and petrified tears. 

"He, um-- he mentioned dating a few other people. Some guy in eighth grade he didn't really care about, but... I don't know what else," I stammered worriedly, eyes big as I looked up to Luka for support.

"I'm not sure either. He hasn't really talked to me about that stuff. But we can figure that out later. Right now, we just need to be here for him." Luka paused, then turned towards Isaac again, putting their hands on his face- which, if anyone else had done it, would've spiked me with jealousy- and whispered very distinctly in his ear to match their breathing.

"Inhale," Luka commanded, "five, four, three, two, one... exhale. Good. Again."

"Should I- should I try that?" I asked, still scared, starting to tremble a bit myself.

"No, I don't think so. It helps more if it's consistent." Luka's face was dead serious, and so was their tone. I felt guilty for not recognizing what was happening to Isaac. Without Luka, what would I have been able to do?

They repeated their mantra and I stayed off to the side, nervously fidgeting with my paws. How could I help? The question was more of an urge than something to be answered. I ''should'' help-- He's my boyfriend, after all! But I didn't know what to do. I didn't, and that fact pained me.

"Inhale. Five, four, three, two, one... Exhale. Good. You're doing good. One more time, Isaac. Breathe with me."

Unintentionally, I started doing the breathing exercise, subconsciously following Luka's instructions. Ironically, it helped me, too. I took another breath- out of beat- and stood up. 

I leaned down again, closer to Isaac, stroking his back like I was giving him a massage. "Hey," I mumbled wistfully, "just take a breath."

Eventually, Luka backed away, letting me take charge. After another twenty minutes or so, Isaac's breathing was back to normal. His temperature had dropped (for the better) and he was shaking a lot less.

"I..." Isaac trailed off. His eyes had been cleared of all mistiness by then. He looked like he was going to say something, but whatever it was remained unexpressed. He stayed mute for a few more minutes, then finally turned to face Luka and I.

"Thanks," he sighed, getting up slowly.

"Um, I, uh... Of course," I replied, my voice low. 

"Do you have... those... a lot?" I squeezed out, face flushed with embarrassment. I couldn't have been asking more stupid questions.

"N- no, they- they don't happen that much. It's just... it's hard to talk about him," Isaac answered shakily, but physically, he was shrugging his shoulders and waving it off. 

Him? I wondered who he was talking about. Teddy, Mr. Johnston, or someone else? I had no clue. I brushed it off, deciding that Isaac probably wouldn't want to talk about it anyways.

"Are you- are you alright? Like, lightheaded or anything? Do you need a snack, or maybe a sip of water?" I implored ambiguously.

"No," Isaac shot back, his quickness coming with a sharp undertone. "I'm fine."

Luka glanced at Isaac, suspicious (although I was too), but didn't say anything out loud- instead, they shook their head, resigned, and padded off. 

Isaac started walking away, and before I left to catch up with him, I pulled out my phone and texted Luka: ''Do you know anything about what just happened? I'm worried about Isaac. That wasn't like him at all.''

I looked up, seeing Luka's phone vibrate a little ways away-- Luka stared back at me for a moment, probably questioning why I didn't walk up to them. I sent them another text to explain.

''I don't want Iz to hear me talking about it. He seemed kind of upset.''

Luka nodded, as if to say ''Ohhh,'' then proceeded to pull up their texts and message me back.

''It was definitely some sort of panic attack. But lots of people have panic attacks- sometimes it's not even because of a specific disorder, it just happens if you bottle things up a lot.'' 

Before I had the chance to reply to their first text, Luka added more information: ''Based on the context, I think Isaac was triggered by your conversation. Not necessarily that you were asking him about his exes or whatever, but it might be one ex in particular that he had a bad relationship with. Not your fault, but just try to tread carefully around that topic next time.''

I hadn't even thought of that. Why didn't I think of any of those things? I wanted to facepalm, but Isaac was probably already dubious of my physicality, so I tried not to make any blatant or dramatic gestures.

''So,'' I inquired via text, ''I shouldn't talk about that with him anymore or he'll start breaking down?''

Again, Luka answered helpfully: ''It's not exactly breaking down completely. Panic attacks can have some physical impacts as well, like migraines, stomach pains, or even passing out. But those don't happen every single time. Basically, stress builds up, stress builds up more, stress isn't discussed or mentioned, panic attack happens.''

''It's also important to know that Isaac MIGHT have a disorder, and given a diagnosis and accommodations, then panic attacks will probably happen a lot less. Again, based on context, the only thing I can think of that he might have is PTSD. Maybe anxiety too? Nevertheless, he definitely needs someone to talk to about it.'' 

I texted back: ''So what you're saying is he needs therapy.''

For a few minutes, Luka doesn't saying anything in response, and all I can see is an ellipsis with the ''Is typing...'' pop-up.

''He might benefit from that. But, to be honest, I think that you should get therapy, too. Talking with a professional is the best solution. It won't solve everything, but it'll help a little.'' 

Me? Get therapy? I hesitated, almost laughing to myself. Luka didn't notice my reaction. After a few more moments of a lack of further conversation, Luka left the chain, and after another couple of minutes, I did, too. 

Then, I could see why Isaac didn't want to talk about his feelings. The same reasons I didn't want to talk about mine.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text bytes="3476" sha1="tgac2mhvlxie2rder2ag18vnhsl9lrb" xml:space="preserve">It was a normal day. I was playing animal jam, and I was editing my den. After a few minutes, I realised the music had been replaced with deep blue but backwards... I thought it could've been a glitch, so I just ignored it. That was my first mistake. A horrifying screech played, followed by fire sounds. I was confused, so I checked if it was a different device. and to my horror, it wasn't. I tried to move my animal and it didn't work. The next thing I thought to do was teleport. It worked but.. I ended up in.. "firefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefire's den" .. what? I've never seen or heard of a player like that. I still heard the sounds.. I searched the username.. A player card.. It's active now! It's animal was unusual, it was an arctic wolf but all orange. No outlines, eyes, nose, nothing. It was on fire. Then something caught my attention. The fire sound was getting louder. I was horrified. I stared at my screen as the same exact "player" walked up to me. It stopped moving. In chat, it said "you ignored me.. so rude.. time to burn..." followed with a "😸" emote. I left the game immediately before things got gross. As I re-entered, it was. . normal..? I was loading. No fire sounds. No screeches. Nothing. I spawned into jamaa township, like usual. No players. I was bored, thinking it was normal again, so I clicked parties. My mind changed as all I saw was just "fire stole." replacing every party.. I just waited until one started. 5 minutes later, it started. I clicked it and I saw a ton of other people! But.. We were all orange. Orange silhouettes of our animals. Happy crazyclaw screamed. Everybody in that party was screaming. Everyone stopped once we saw the arctic wolf walking up to us all. It did the "😾" emote. It walked up to a fox named something like.. Sweet pouncypaws.. I can't remember. Anyways, the arctic wolf said it's name and it disappeared. It did that with other people. It then got to me. It said my username and animal name, and I got kicked. Right before though, I saw myself go up in flames. I re-entered the game but instead of any loading screens, it showed my animal. Burning. I closed the game once again, getting annoyed. I waited a few hours. Once I re-opened the game, it was actually normal. Players. Normal music. My den was back to normal. I had a jam-a-gram waiting to be seen. It was from the person. It said "player is now safe." with a get well soon card. Am I now free? I checked my buddy list, they were in it. It said " Over 30 days "..  I checked chat to see if I could do anything with someone. all it said was.. "you shouldn't have checked here." and then someone said along with it, " all players who check here never.. never.. NEVER.. get away. " and then before I read the 3rd message, I was sent to my den. all teleport buttons gone. It was.. my first accounts den.. A masterpiece was  on the wall saying "she was with us. She.. was the start of this." I then was kicked. I didn't log back in for a while and when I did, it was better. It was normal. No jam-a-grams, they weren't even my buddy. I was finally free.


==Read please!==
This story is all made up! I was just bored so I made this.  All that was real was the orange arctic wolf! This is all based off of me seeing one (mainly the tail) in my den! It was just a second and nothing happened. Thanks if you read it tho! If you include it in any videos, please do credit me. You can call me Skittle!

=== A fairly light hearted romance around two girls based off of my actual AJ pets. Not the best written one, that’s a warning. ===

== Where many (academic) journeys begin: 1 ==
''“Take care Kitty.”'' My guardian told me as they gave a soft pat on my head before departing, they packed me some food, a tuna sandwich and some boiled eggs with a bottle of water. It’s a good enough meal, it’s my first day at Mythol High, looking back on it now, the name was kind of silly in a way. Either way, I was nervous. I could feel small drops of sweat under my fur but I shook my head and walked out the gates and followed the path.

It was a fairly short walk, my legs are used to walking a lot since my guardian takes me to a lot of places in jamaa so they didn’t hurt that much. The students here seemed pretty mature and cool to me, I think I could get used to this. I’m not sure actually.

Walking across the school grounds, the building seemed pretty high quality. Pretty nice building with a dark blue color scheme that was easy on the eyes, it’s not too fancy either, just fancy enough. I like it like that. The gold bits on the design was nice too. I think I should stop admiring the nice building now, I think I could try talking to the students since it doesn’t seem all too busy right now.

Someone catches my eyes tho..

== Pink and black butterflies: 2 ==
Dark grey scaled, light pink parts, a nice mohawk that fits well with her scales, she has some visible eyebags, a cute vest and pretty amber eyes and eyelashes, oh uh.. I think I- uh- Oh she’s looking at me- uh-

''“uh hey.”''

uh oh god what do I say, do, or- oh god oh zios oh mira oh- ack-

''“Are you ok..?”'' She asks me.

''“UH- yeah. I am. Hi, What’s your name..?”''

''“Fizzy, you?“''

''“I’m Kitty, it’s a basic name for a tabby, isn’t it?”''

''“I gues- oh, class. Well, bye.”'' That.. that went ok I think. Zios, that was.. an experience for sure. I got little bugs in my gut talking to her. I.. I wonder why. I think I should go to class. That girl was.. cool.

Well, this is gonna be my first class now. I should get going, I can’t get her off my mind even after we just met. Am I just obsessive?

== First class. Not that bad, really.: 3 ==
Walking through the school’s interior, it has that distinct perfume shop smell. Just a lot less sickly sweet. It really is that good. Well, gotta find my classroom now. Wait- wait I wasn’t told where my classroom was- uh- I think it’s.. “Ms. Redtail’s Cooking class”? The rooms got a sweet smell to it, like strawberry cake frosting, or muffins being baked. Let me just..

Walking into the room, it’s got a rather valentines-like feel to it. looks to have many animals cooking something. Cupcakes, strawberry cake like I mentioned, candies and other sweets, it’s a lot. The teacher who I assume is Ms. Redtail looks at me, seems to be an arctic wolf with swiss cherry fur with a patterned apron and a bow on her neck. Her tail has a fade to it.

''“Ah, Kitty! Welcome to class, I don’t mind if you’re late. You’re new after all, anyways.”'' She says, she has an almost motherly voice. ''“Everyone, that’s Kitty. Your new classmate. And she’d describe herself as..”'' uh- I’d describe myself as.. uhm..

''“I would describe myself as- uh.. me..?”'' Everyone looks at me quietly, actually, Fizzy’s in the class too! And.. she’s looking at me. She remembers our little chat.  ''“Well, if you’re too nervous, I don’t mind! I won’t force you. Everyone goes at their own pace. Now, take a seat over there.”'' Redtail tells me and points a paw to a seat next to the seat Fizzy is. Not sitting with her, just the person beside her table. She seems to be a labrador, designer dress, red collar and a little beret. Her collar looks similar to mine actually, just red. Must be the same designer who made them. She looks to be happy to have me sit next to her. She’s also already whisking something in a bowl.

''“Hey there! I’m patchpaw, you?”'' She says in an excited voice. ''“Kitty.”'' I reply. ''“Wanna be friends?”'' Asking to be friends this quickly? Uh, sure I guess. She doesn’t seem that bad and I don’t have much to lose. I distantly gaze at Fizzy from my seat while Patchpaw beats her tail on the chair in excitement as she nearly falls off the chair from leaning too far.

''“We’re making desserts today! I’ll be making some cake. You can help!”'' Hm, that explains the sweet smells coming from here. ''“Uh, Patchpaw? I’m not good at baking or just cooking in general so..” “That’s ok! You can still try!”'' Oh this won’t go well.

''“Here, Kitty! Try pouring the batter in the pan!”'' Handing the bowl into my paws, she expects me to pour it into the black pan on the table. ''“I think you should. I could accidentally spill a little.”'' Getting the tables dirty wouldn’t be good. ''“That’s ok! I can deal with it!”'' How.. exactly? ''“I like licking off the batter! Especially if it’s cookie dough. Taste good!”'' Oh uh.. that’s.. kind of.. weird. ''“Let’s get baking now, friend!”'' As she waits for me. I hold the bowl and pour it carefully into the rectangular pan and watch it all go in.

''“Great! Let’s get it in the oven now!”'' Taking the batter filled pan, I put it in the oven and close the door. Patchpaw sets it to25 minutes and looks at me happily. ''“You’re pretty good for the new girl!” “Thanks..”'' 

''“let’s talk a bit while we wait!”'' Uh, what’s the school like? ''“Oh it’s really cool! Cool people, cool teachers who aren’t mean, I like it here!”'' Sounds good. How about Redtail? She came off as pretty nice at first, but is she different actually? ''“She’s as sweet as she seems! She smells like strawberries!”'' She seems proper. ''“Also, you were talking to Fizzy, what did you think of her?”'' Uh, fizzy? She’s.. nice. She looks nice too. And she has nice eyes. ''“Oooh! Someone’s got a crush!”'' PATCHPAW DONT- don’t say that, please.. she’s sitting right next to-

''“What were you guys talking about? Crushes?”'' ohziosohziosohziosohzios OH MIRA- uhm, ''“she was-“'' I put a paw on Patchpaw’s mouth. ''“just- just shut up.” “Oh, okie dokie!”'' God. ''“Huh. Well, if you were talking about crushes, never really had one.”'' Then Fizzy turns and goes back to her seat. Peering over, she’s making donuts. Cream filled donuts.

''“you don’t wanna talk about your crush?” “Yes, I don’t. Not when uh.. someone’s right next to me.” “Ok!”'' Then I hear a “ding!” noise from below. It’s already been 25 minutes?

== Cakes, Donuts and pies: 4 ==
Taking out the fresh cake and placing it on the table, Patchpaw already has the light yellow frosting and she’s already spreading it on the cake which smells of vanilla and lemons. Seems to be a lemon cake. Tasty. I look over to Fizzy’s seat and she’s putting the chocolate frosting on her donuts, while the animal sitting with her seems to be waiting for their turn to fill the donuts.

After finishing frosting the cake, Patchpaw looks at me and gives me the coupler with white frosting, finished with the light yellow lemon frosting. ''“You decorate the cake! You can try it!”'' Uh, Patchpaw? I don’t think it would be a good idea, I wouldn’t do well. The oven was easy, not sure about decorations. ''“Oh, well, okie!”'' Taking the coupler from my paws, she pretty nicely decorates the cake with little drops of frosting on the cake’s top. I notice a bag of decorations also, stars, little balls, and heart shaped things are in it, taking it, I think this would be easy enough… actually, considering it now I think I could’ve done the frosting drops too. Oh well, too late now.

Dotting the decorations  a bit all over the place, but not without a bit of thought, I think the cake looks good enough. Looking at Fizzy’s table, her partners filling the donuts with cream now. I think everyone’s ready now.

''“Alright, students! Step off and place your sweet treats on my table for the rating!”'' Redtail speaks and the students get off their seats, Patchpaw carries the lemon cake and goes over to the table.

First was a rat and a mouse, their cupcakes were given a 7/10.

Second was a highland cow and a squirrel, their cookies were given a 6/10. Redtail mentioned they tasted a bit like qheat.

Third was a tasmanian devil and a mantis, their cheesecake was given a 9/10. Redtail liked how soft and delicate it was.

Fourth was Fizzy and her partner. she was given 9/10 too. Her donuts looked crispy and nice.

After the next two students had their treats rated, it came to us now. I was anticipating, and we placed the cake on the table. Redtail sniffs it and lightly smiles and cuts a piece, then takes a bite of the lemony cake. I hear an audible ‘mm!’ from her and I hear her say: ''“A solid 10/10! Great job you two!”'' And followed with a soft, approving smile and a nod. I could’ve sworn the tasmanian devil gave me a salty glare while his mantis friend looked like she couldn’t contain her anger. The rat, the cow, the mouse, and the squirrel didn’t really seem to mind. The cow seemed happy for me. So did Fizzy, something makes me wish Fizzy won tho.

''“Class dismissed my students! I’ll take my time cleaning the classroom.”'' Ms. Redtail says, and everyone starts to leave. ''“That was fun Kitty! We won!”'' Yeah, I guess. I notice fizzy coming, I think she’s friends with Patchpaw. ''“Hey Patch. And also Kitty, Nice win you got there.”'' My mouth has a slight coppery taste. I feel a light blush on my face, ''“Well, Kitty, Patch, I’ll be going. Again, you did good. Both of you.”'' Oh zios. ''“Hey Kitty! Did you know Fizzy’s my friend?”'' I think so now. ''“She tends to hang out with the music club, she’s good at guitar!”'' I think I like her more now. ''“But her friends don’t really like me. They kinda think I’m annoying but.. I’m trying to fit in!”'' Well, ok. It was a good lesson, I think I can go. Bye Patchpaw. As I wave her goodbye and walk off, she yells a ''“Bye!”.''

== Bevil and Molly: 5 ==
Patchpaw was kind of a lot for me, she’s nice but a bit energetic. I think I could see her as a friend. she’s friends with fizzy, but if I ever join her friend trio, I honestly wish Fizzy would spend more time with me then her or more attention to me. Wait, no, that’s just selfish, isn’t it? And attention seeking.. and not good.. and..

I hear a yell, i could make out a ''“HEADS UP KITTY KITTY!”'' And- OW-

''“Hah! I thought cats land on their feet Kitty Cat!”'' My head is spinning and I think I was tripped or hit across the head, rubbing my aching head I look up, the mantis from the cooking class who looked angry at me. Light blue hoodie, satin purple skirt under, she’s actually kind of pretty, but alas, she’s deceiving.

''“Nice one Molly!”'' The Tasmanian devil who was paired with the mantis cheers her on. ''“Thanks Bevil! Got the Kitty cat good!”'' They seem to be friends. A dubious little duo. ''“Smell ya later litter box!” “Yeah go win a sleeping competition first before you win cooking classes!”'' And they leave.

Wow, made first friends, then enemies. Really quick.

This may be gory! Read at your own risk.
==Story==
The blood covered fox is a normal fox, taking the appearance of any fox in the area, but gorier. It might have no face. No body. But the gory thing is.. it's always covered in blood. Sometimes it can have gvt$ spilling out.

There's ways to summon it. '''(REMEMBER THIS IS FAKE! DO NOT TRY THESE.)'''

1. Every person in the area HAS to be a fox. You then all make a circle while sleeping, with one non-fox player in the middle. They start chanting " Oh.. Bloody fox. Bloody fox. so my friends have fallen. Are they dead? Are they not? " One then gets up. "Bloody fox, bloody fox, my friend has woken. Will you save another?" another gets up, and until all of them are up keep saying it. Once all are up bloody fox should be somewhere.

2. Be alone in an area or den. Anywhere works. Be a wolf. Bloody fox hates wolves. Then say "Bloody fox do you recognise me? I guess you would, because you do hate me." Then wait 5 - 30 mins.

3. Make a masterpiece of bloody fox. Put it in an empty den. Needs to be yours.

Now, bloody fox does so much. It flashes up pictures of d€@d foxes and wolves, broken bones, gvt$, and much more gore. It can really. REALLY. Traumatize you. when seen, it will be eating any d€@d animal. Alphas aswell. If it's targeting you, it will be eating you when seen. And trust me. You don't wanna be targeted. Its horrible. You could get banned. 

One thing that shows you're safe is if it isn't eating. No animals, no alphas, nothing. Just blood.

      <text bytes="5215" sha1="90vctajb6xpa8hrx2aob7ienmydvrbs" xml:space="preserve">Once upon a time, in the world of Animal Jam, there was a player named Entity6666. He was known to be a skilled hacker, and some even claimed that he had the power to control the game itself. Many players were afraid of him, and some even whispered that he was not a human, but an entity that had taken over the body of a player.

The rumors about Entity6666 only grew when he appeared in Null's Den, a dark and eerie place that was said to be haunted by unknown entities. Entity6666's wolf had an all-black fur with a red swirl pattern, and his eyes were white as snow. He never spoke, except in Morse code, which only added to his mysterious persona.

Some players claimed to have seen him teleport around the game, and others said that he could make their screens flicker and glitch with a single keystroke. But the most terrifying thing about Entity6666 was the fact that he seemed to be always watching, always aware of what was happening in the game.

One day, a group of players decided to investigate the rumors surrounding Entity6666. They followed him around the game, trying to communicate with him, but he remained silent, only responding in code. They tried to report him to the game administrators, but they found that Entity6666 seemed to have no player ID or history. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air, a true entity within the game.

As the group of players continued their investigation, they began to experience strange occurrences. Their screens would flicker, and they would hear strange noises that seemed to come from within the game itself. They soon realized that Entity6666 was not just a player, but something much more sinister.

The group of players eventually decided to leave the game, too afraid to continue playing with Entity6666 lurking in the shadows. But some say that he still remains, watching and waiting for his next victim. They say that if you ever come across him, you should run, for Entity6666 is not just a player, but an entity that has taken over the game itself. Rumors spread quickly among the Animal Jam community about the mysterious Entity6666. Some claimed that he was a ghost, while others believed he was a demon come to haunt the game. But the truth remained a mystery.

As time went on, more players reported encountering Entity6666. Some claimed that he had the power to control their accounts, while others said he had the ability to teleport players into Null's Den against their will.

Despite the growing fear and concern, the game administrators remained silent on the matter. They never acknowledged the existence of Entity6666, nor did they take any action to remove him from the game.

As a result, many players began to leave the game, fearful of encountering Entity6666. The once-thriving community of Animal Jam was slowly dwindling, and the game became a ghost town.

But the legend of Entity6666 lived on. Some players claimed to have seen his wolf lurking in the shadows of other games, while others swore that they had received messages from him outside of the game.

To this day, the true nature of Entity6666 remains a mystery. Some believe that he was a hacker, while others are convinced that he was something much more sinister. But one thing is for certain: those who encountered Entity6666 will never forget the fear and terror that he brought to the game of Animal Jam. Entity6666's reign of terror continued, and players were still afraid to encounter him in the game. One day, a player known only as "UrNext" received a message from Entity6666. The message spelled out "UrNext" using pillows in the background, which sent chills down UrNext's spine.

This was the last straw for the game administrators, who finally took action against Entity6666. They banned him from the game, and many players breathed a sigh of relief. But Entity6666 was not done yet.

He returned to the game under a new account, EntityReturns. His appearance was the same as before, with the all-black fur, red swirl pattern, and white eyes. This time, he was even more dangerous than before.

Players who encountered EntityReturns reported that he had the ability to teleport them to Null's Den, where they would be trapped and unable to escape. Some even claimed that he had the power to control their accounts and steal their items.

The game administrators tried to ban EntityReturns, but he always seemed to find a way back into the game. Some players even speculated that he had found a way to hack into the game's servers and bypass the bans.

As time went on, more players left the game, afraid to encounter EntityReturns. The game became a shadow of its former self, and the once-thriving community of Animal Jam was reduced to a handful of players.

To this day, EntityReturns remains a legend in the game of Animal Jam. Some players claim that he still lurks in the shadows, waiting for his next victim. Whether he is a hacker, a ghost, or something much more sinister, one thing is for certain: those who encounter EntityReturns will never forget the fear and terror that he brings to the game.

He was known to be a skilled hacker, and some even claimed that he had the power to control the game itself. Many players were afraid of him, and some even whispered that he was not a human, but an entity that had taken over the body of a player.

Written by XxAmberleaf

This is the first story in the Dark Shadows trilogy. This is my first long story on the wiki!

== Blurb ==
Flora is fed up.

She's been used to the life of a princess, where all anyone cares about is protecting her, and finding her a prince. But she knows it's not her.

When the strange Darkness that's been plaguing her country comes to her city, she finds herself getting strange nightmares about a pale fox who calls herself Sandy. Alongside this, she begins to have memories of her childhood, which the Alphas erased from her mind. She’s not who she thinks she is.

At first, she’s excited. This is her chance to escape the life she’s trapped in. But she didn’t expect the sacrifice along the way…

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Prologue ==
There is a phantom portal hidden in the palace dungeons.

I know because I’ve been there, in secret, to train in the ways I’ve never been allowed to. 

It is only a temporal portal, not strong at all, and it serves as training to the royal guard. The dungeons haven’t been used in years so it was the perfect place for a little bit of darkness. Nobody can be injured past being knocked out for an hour. I am embarrassed to say that I have passed out before. The servants found me and I was locked inside my room for a week. 

They say it’s for my own safety, but I don’t want to be safe. For as long as I can remember all my thoughts are: Get revenge on the Phantoms. I don’t even know what for. But I know that I need to.

My name is Flora. I’m a fennec fox. I am one of Jamaa’s princesses, but although I’m the oldest, I know I’ll never become queen. I’m okay with that- perhaps pleased. I don’t have any true royal blood in me, so the throne will go to 17-year-old Snowy. 

I was brought to the palace by the Alphas when I was ten. I can’t remember any part of my life before that, though. I would be lying if I said that I was glad the Alphas took me here. I assure you, royalty is not all it’s cracked up to be. Yes, I have a small house as my bedroom; yes, I get to eat fancy banquets every day three times a day, but where’s the freedom?

== Chapter One ==
The first thing they try to drill into me is how fragile life is. Life is something that we should protect and nurture, It isn’t something that we should take for granted, and we had to be safe so that we could live long, peaceful lives and die old, due to natural causes.

But I say: what’s the point of life if you don’t live it to the full? Taking a deep breath, I leap of the edge of the boat.

We are on holiday at Crystal Springs- today we are taking a luxury cruse around Bahari Bay. I would prefer to be actually swimming in Bahari Bay, but oh well. 

Royalty never goes into saltwater- apparently it makes our fur matted. But I couldn’t care as it is more fun to fool around in the perfect waters.

But the best part was that I splashed Snowy as I messily enter the water. She squeals. I snort with laughter, and (childishly, I know), splash her more.

The difference between me and Snowy is, well, everything. She is a bunny, I a fennec fox. She is born into the royalty, but I am an orphan. And most importantly, she is your traditional textbook image of a princess. Nobody needs to tell you how I certainly am not.

“How dare you, Flora?!” She gasp. (Her handmaiden pats her dry.) “Have you no dignity?”

”None.” I laugh.

”I request that you get out of there, Your Majesty. You might catch a cold and die.” 

I snort. It is 40 degrees Celsius (around 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and the warmest day of the year so far. There is no chance of catching a cold in this weather, let alone a fatal one.) That’s Lightning-Moon, though, head of the Royal Guard, constantly fussing about one thing or another. It’s really exasperating. 

I dragged myself out of the water and shook myself dry. Snowy glares at me so I just smile innocently back at her, taking a seat on one of the fancy deckchairs. 10-year-old Airis and toddler Honest are gossiping about phantoms again.

”Is it true, that the royal guard had to fight off the phantoms before we left?” Honest says nervously, playing with her paws.

“Yes.” Airis leans over to hold his sister’s paw. “But that’s alright. The royal guard drove them back. They will protect us.”

”The royal guard is weak.” I couldn’t resist butting in. “The royal guard didn’t drive them back, we had to flee! The alphas are probably at our palace right now.”


''The battle was short yet bloodthirsty. The phantoms had surprised us just before we were heading off. I darted to my wardrobe-that-could-fit-a-bed and rummaged through bows upon bows upon laces upon laces to find the boomseed launcher backpack that I normally kept hidden. I used it in the portal and in case of an emergency, like today. I loaded it and darted towards the servant’s door, knowing that I’d be stopped if I went out the main door.''</text>

This story is about the lost jammer’s orgin. It’s not a Creepypasta, since it’s not told from first person.

== The Story ==
There was once a jammer named Fman122. He was known for hacking, which was against ToS. Fman122 planned of taking over the world using his skills. Why? Fman122 had good ideas of saving Jamaa, but people would never listen. This made him mad. Fman122 went off to see the phantom king for hacking tips. The phantom king accepted his request and began training with him. This took about 3 years. After his training, Fman122 was ready to come back and take over. Many jammers started to get hacked using a jam-a-gram signal. A wolf named ILoveBlackberries3153 was noticing this, and wanted to stop it. 

“I am going to Fman122, I’m gonna stop him.” Blackberries stated everywhere he went, on an endless journey to find Fman122. Many jammers were worried, what was gonna happened? Would Blackberries get hacked? Echoes of conversation and worries filled Jamaa. “He might get hacked, he can get naive at times.” “Wish you luck, you’ll need it.” “Mommy, will cousin be safe?” “We will meet again, some sunny day….” It was making Blackberries uncomfortable. On a cold, chilly night at Mt. Shiver, Blackberries found the phantom portal. He took a step inside, just as a purple bolt shot up his leg. “Ouch!” Blackberries said, jolting away. Snow covered his snout, his blood jumping up and down inside there. ''No, Blackberries, you can do this!'' He got up, shook off the snow, and took a step. Then, Blackberries jumped in.

He fell onto a dusty, purple track. Blackberries shook his head as he got up. “BLURBY SLURPY!” “EOOOBABLE” “BABLEEOOOO” Phantom sounds came from all around. The grass was black, and several burnt trees with green lava leaking from inside and hanging on branches could be seen. It was eerie. Blackberries trotted on the track, which was a long road covered by burnt trees with green and purple goo rubbed against their branches. He looked around, worried. He trotted for about a hour, until he stopped for some peace and quiet. Blackberries got onto a purple bench with black stands and armrests, one piece was dangling from the one he sat one. As soon as he laid down, a screech came from above, and all his sight went black.

He woke up to find a black wolf with a fiery red flame pattern, a white underbelly, and two solid red eyes, staring into his soul. They were in a pitch black room, with only one greenish light standing above them. “Ahh, isn’t it my new friend?” The wolf laughed, grabbing his chin. He moved it like a ventriloquist moving a puppet’s mouth. “Your Fman?” Blackberries asked, recognizing the face from a poster. “The one and only!” the wolf answered, slowly losing his comedic tone into a slithery tone. “Oh, well, can you stop hacking?” Blackberries asked again. Fman dropped Blackberries’ jaw and sat in front of him. “I won’t stop hacking.” he said. “Please stop. Two of my friends got hacked by you already.” Blackberries said, his voice raising a bit. “Were they: ClubPenguinFan3 and CricketCoolCrickets?” Fman laughed, getting off the floor.

”Yes, they were!” Blackberries yelled furiously. “Should’ve said bye-bye to them, you’re going down too.” Fman answered, his claws being unsheathed. “I’m not, you are!” Blackberries yelled, pouncing on Fman. “Only if you obey me, you’ll live.” Fman said, shaking Blackberries off. “Fine.” he said. Fman smiled, suddenly, Blackberries was mind-controlled, or it felt like it. Years passed, and already Blackberries was a hacker. He was known by the name of the lost jammer, due to him being lost. Blackberries furiously hacked other players, until the control of Fman. One day, Fman came up to The Lost Jammer. “I want you to hack the alphas, put them into phantoms. If you’re caught, I’ll avenge you.” The Lost Jammer nodded, typing in so many codes. He had 60 members of Wildworks banned, logging into their accounts and saying offensive things to get them banned. There was no stopping him.

Then a bang came as soon as he got into the code. Jammers came in with trained pet phantoms to kill Fman and the Lost Jammer. The Lost Jammer exited the code part and started to ban all players in the den. He quietly said their names. “Cookiesprinkes123OMG, Sonicfan102, Pufferdish9999999…” Nearly all the jammers were banned, but it was too late. Fman was dead. “No!” the Lost Jammer cried. “My…my, mentor!” He burst into tears, the droplets hitting strands of Fman’s fur. The Lost Jammer grieved for him, until the next year, he got an idea.

The Lost Jammer slid into the mantle of Fman’s place. Now, he was Fman. To this day, The Lost Jammer roams Jamaa, looking for the nest victim.

=== Prologue ===
A crisp, chilly breeze blew across the reeds in the early spring morning. Frost glittered on the edges of the grass as a slender black snow leopard speckled with green spirals padded across the riverbank. He appeared to have rather fancy attire, a fedora and a green bow tie.  It was still only the beginning of spring and while warmer weather had started to roll in, the cold of the prior winter still lingered, especially in the mornings just after sunrise. The lone leopard had chosen to go off alone, split apart from his normal duties he was assigned to as he so often did these days. He found that he much preferred the solitude over being with his co-workers, given he already felt so distant from them.

“Terrence!”

He whirled around, snarling as he came face to face with his own leader. He realized his mistake, and quickly apologized with a respectful dip of his head. The gray snow leopard didn’t seem too fazed, instead laying his tail on his shoulder to try calming him down. Red had similar clothing, a red fedora and bow tie, which matched his red markings. “I was ''gonna'' tell you about the party we were gonna have today. Y’know, escaping from the government’s grip yet again.” 

Terrence blinked a little. “''A party?”'' he echoed, his yellow eyes narrowed in confusion. “Sir, you know we can’t just throw around our mon-“

”Relax, mate! What happened to you that made you hate fun?” he replied flippantly, flicking his tail. It was a natural habit of his, Red never really took things seriously, and usually flicked his tail when he wasn’t taking anything seriously. “Look, you know you’re second in line for leadership and all that junk, so how about you enjoy your time before it’s all back to paperwork and heists?” he said, loosening up a little more. 

Terrence took a deep, shuddering breath to calm his nerves. “Alright… fine. I’ll try.” He finally agreed, wrapping his tail around his paws. Red let out a victorious chuckle, beginning to turn. 

“Party’s at twelve!” he exclaimed as he left. Soon enough, Terrence could barely see his shadow over the hill, the sun beaming in his direction. He was worried about how much money they were spending. He felt awful for even trying to deny his leader. Another part of him whispered in his ear, telling him that he was second in line, it was his job to make sure the organization stayed afloat. 

Finally, Terrence picked himself up and headed back to the headquarters, hoping that the shadows would keep the building nothing but a secret, along with all the crimes that would surely send him to a ''far, far'' different place if he were to die.

=== '''Chapter One (WIP, DO NOT EDIT.)''' ===
A large bunny bounded through the desolate forest, it’s breath hitched in its throat. Breathing heavily, it turned to look behind it. A shark-hyena mix was chasing it, rapidly gaining up. This was its chance. The bunny skidded to a stop, quickly maneuvering itself sideways. It searched its military uniform for the switchblade safely in its grasp, and expertly knocked the hyena over. Standing over his target, Charles let out a victorious chuckle. “Fifth time in a row I beat ya, and I gotta say, that’s pretty embarrassing, Switchblade.”

“Funny for you to talk.” Switchblade objected, vaulting to his feet. “Especially with that stupid punk pilot hat you’re so proud of.” He added bitterly, his orca tail lashing in annoyance. 

Charles just hummed and nodded, deflecting the insult. He did that a lot. Walking past the hyena, he began to make his way toward camp. The forest felt infinite around them, trees towering above them. The sun glared down at them from the early daylight, making shade a priority for them. He brought his attention purely towards getting back, and wouldn’t do anything else until he had this goal done. It was a bad habit of his, but he always thought it was a better way to get things done then letting them pile up.

'''Fēng Xu,''' sometimes referred to as '''Fēng Hsu,''' is one of the many supporting characters in A Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. She is affiliated with Locaster's group and the current owner of the wind gem that once belonged to the wind founding demon, Aeris, and the second youngest shard user out of all the characters.

== History ==
Fēng was primarily raised in a middle class area in Misterin and lived a fairly simple life with her parents. However, when she was five, she had caught a high fever and underwent treatment intensely. Unfortunately, she had went blind due to the severity of the fever. It had started off as having blurry vision, but eventually had total vision lost. 

At a young age, Fēng was mostly sheltered for a good portion of her life because she was seen as fragile due to her blindness and was often kept inside her home due to the fear that she would get hurt or be incapable of taking care of herself. She was pulled out of school and had to learn how to read braille. Eventually, her parents had found a shard of a gem that was able to assist her in seeing and crafted a staff with the shard in the center.  

When receiving the staff, the shard allowed her to see through it and acted as her vision. She was eventually not as sheltered as before due to her adapting to using her staff and was allowed to finally be outside and do day-to-day things to help her parents. Shortly after, Fēng discovered that the gem on the staff had wind powers and started to experiment with the magic that the shard held and was able to quickly use the powers to defend herself, but hid the powers from her parents. 

Fēng was one of Crow Watanabe's targets during the height of him being a shard thief, but due to her being blind and needing the gem, he had spared her life and did not take her shard from her. After some months, she was discovered by Soul Kawasaki in a forest and was recruited to become apart of Locaster's group, and then discovers that her shard was one of the demon gems that was owned by Aeris, the wind founding demon. She immediately became friends With Nabi Haluška due to them sharing similar interests and being in the same age range. Locaster describes them both as being inseparable, not leaving ones side in any moment, even in dire situations.   

== Appearance ==

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Fēng is a petite girl standing around 5'6 with pale skin and white eyes. She has medium length silver hair tied into a bun and wears a white flower crown on the top of her head.

Fēng's attire consists of a gray shirt with dark gray cuffs at the end and a gray skirt to match with a cloak that covers most of her body, white stockings and white boots with gray outlining on the top. She is mostly seen holding her staff, which is brown and has the wind gem in the middle. 

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Fēng's Animal Jam Model is a fox that has a white upper fur and a beige underbelly with white eyes and light gray patterns. She wears a white flower crown, A black long spiked collar with an epic alpha staff with a white crystal on the side of her hip. Around her wrists are black elf tail bracelets and on her tail is a spirit tail armor. 

== Personality ==
Initially, Fēng was seen to be a rather shy and reclusive individual. She often remained quiet and had a disdain for speaking to others because of how she was sheltered for a portion of her life. She frequently had trouble with talking to others, let alone socializing with others around her and can get overwhelmed when presented with too much attention drawn to her and suffers from panic attacks whenever those moments occur. She remained socially awkward for awhile and could only hold up basic conversations but not exactly talk to anyone sufficiently.        

After she was recruited in Locaster's group, Fēng experiences a drastic personality change and becomes slightly more social with the other members, but still remains meek when attempting to speak to others on a more deeper and personal level. She enjoys to tease her aquaintances in a playful manner and has a soft spot for white rabbits, admitting the reason why is because of her pet rabbit back at Misterin that her parents now take care of due to her being out of the kingdom.       

Fēng is shown to be adaptable, being able to adapt to any setting rather quickly, as when the group had to stay in the dark forest for the night, most of them had problems with adjusting while she was able to adapt to the environment around her. Fēng is not a very socially aware individual, having a hard time picking up social cues and signals from others and can have a hard time understanding obscene humor or basic jokes for that matter. Because of this, Fēng is a sensitive individual and can react to jokes that she finds crude or insensitive.            

Despite her naturally quiet and inept disposition, when in combat, Fēng gains a more hardened, serious persona, often trying to protect her friends from danger, as seen when she blocks an attack from a Lyakonian soldier being directed at Nabi. Her personality further shifts in combat, becoming more sharp-tongued and a little brash as Ashton would describe.            

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' As the youngest shard user, Fēng is a very powerful magic user and combatant. Despite not having much muscle in her body to do larger scale attacks, Fēng combines her physical strength with her shard in order to make up for it. Instead of using up most of her physical strength, Fēng opts to using partial of her wind powers in order to quickly ambush and knock down her targets with powerful wind blasts.    

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Fēng possesses superhuman-like speed, slipping away from Misaya's ghost arms and quickly dashing off. With her speed also comes her reflexes, as she was able to evade the Lyakonian soldier's gunshots with only minor injuries and effortlessly dodges both Cassian and Akuji's attacks, only coming back with minor injuries afterwards. Despite not being the fastest, she was able to out-pace Ashton in a race when they were residing in the Northern Forests.      

'''Enhanced Strength:''' Despite her being one of the more shorter members, Fēng has exemplified to possess demon-like strength, being able to knock down many Lyakonian soldiers in a mere second and nearly go head on with Cassian during their escape from Lyakon and outsmarting him in order to run away from him. She is capable of also lifting u a broken down tree that had fallen during their escape from Lyakon.        

'''Enhanced Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Fēng has shown to possess inhuman-like stamina &amp; endurance. She was able to chase after Crow when he started to run away and did not express any exhaustion, remaining in optimal physical and emotional shape. Her stamina is high enough to a point where she was able to hop across many tree branches in high trees without having to hesitate or get tired.          

'''Tactical Intellect:''' Studying the demon gems and Demonian, Fēng is an exceptionally clever and resourceful individual.

When sookasvoloch woke up, sookasvoloch saw that he has turned into A CHEESE JAMMER!!!!!!!!!!!! The Cheese god comes out of the shadows and said "I have sold your soul to me, Cheese god. You're now cheese, there's no way back...You will always be cheese, you will suffer forever now ass cheese" 

Sookasvoloch was trembling in terror...How did this happen?!?! Why am I cheese?!?!?!!? Since when I signed a contract!!!!!! What have you done to my family??!?!?!? Cheese god said, "I have sacrificed your family, it's part of the ritual." Cheese god hits sookasvoloch's head with a humongous cheese statue and sookasvoloch blackout again. 

Sookasvoloch woke up in Jamma township, traumatized by the experience... He recalled the things that have happened to him...

"I have become cheese now... The Cheese gods have sacrificed my family... I am no longer what I used to be... I am cheese now... There's no way back to the past... This is my life now... I am cheese now... Why have the Cheese gods done this to me... I am part of cheese... I'm forever cheese... I have sold my soul to the cheese gods..."

'''Cassian Adylet Packard''' is one of the central antagonists in a Good Vs Evil Roleplay. He is the commander of the National Army of Lyakon, often being portrayed as a strict ruler with soldiers that serve directly under his name. He is often referred to as being one of the youngest commanders in his fleet and one of the most enhanced in his division.  

== History ==
Cassian was the oldest of six siblings and lived in a more sustainable area of Lyakon. He was the son of Aslan Adylet, a Kazakh general, and Lenore Packard, a Greek conductor. Cassian had a close relationship with his father and often trained with him when he was off duty, giving him a passion for combat and fighting. At some point in his life, Cassian's father had died because of a landmine explosion when he was overseas, being alerted via a telegram. He was also gifted his opal earrings that were recovered from his body after the accident. This event had changed his personality from a kind, yet tough individual to being quick-to-anger and incredibly violent.  

After multiple expulsions from school due to getting into a handful of physical conflicts, Cassian was sent to juvenile camp for two years because of his behavior, but was eventually released early due to cleaning up his act. To avoid getting into more conflict and to follow his father's footsteps, he joined the army when he was thirteen in order to discipline himself and quickly rose above the ranks before becoming a commander at fourteen. 

Cassian is listed as being the youngest commander by both the king and many of the royal soldiers, being not only the youngest but the most enhanced because of his past training with his father. He is often sent out on missions on the kings behalf and exhibited charisma, leadership and also showing to be an incredibly intelligent man who was able to lead their army into victory, defeating many high ranking militaries that were sent to fight them and defeated them all due to his excellent coordination skills.       

Cassian has also trained [[Akuji Hasegawa]], but has implied to have abused him when he was a soldier in training, being rather harsh with him and degraded him for not giving a well than exemplar performance and caused their relationship with one another to sour. Though, after four years, the both of them were on an even playing field, despite their flaws and problems with one another.      

Cassian first appears after Akuji and the Lyakonian soldiers had tracked down Locaster's group in order to turn Ashton in. He was the odd signal that Yuna had detected during the groups heinous battle with the soldiers. He quickly fired his gun at Locaster before he had ducked and evaded the attack. The both of them had engaged in a fight before getting kicked off and fought by Damion, nearly overpowering him because of Damion existing long before he did, but quickly punched him down and pursued after Locaster.        

While he pursued Locaster, many other soldiers followed and he ordered them to tire out all the demons and shard users as much as possible in order to put them in a vulnerable position. As the soldiers were following his orders, Cassian spots Locaster and slams him down to the ground, holding him by the neck. After he blasts Cassian off, the two have a one-on-one. Locaster was confused because of how he appeared and was rather intimidated by his aura, but also did not know who he was.           

== Appearance ==

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Cassian is a tall, pale man of Kazakh and Greek descent with raven black hair tied into a braid and white eyes with black, star-like patterns in them. According to Ashton, on the side of his neck is a supposed bite mark.  

Cassian is often seen wearing a black trench-coat with a dark gray bodysuit-like shirt underneath and light gray sweat pants; Around his waist is a lighter gray belt, and sports opal, ovular earrings with silver lining on the outside. His gloves in his drawing are black, though in his Gacha Club Model, they are shown to be white. On the side of his waist is a gun holder that has a double barrel gun on the inside.  

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Cassian's Animal Jam Model is a Arctic Wolf with a black outer fur and a paler inner fur with white eyes and star patterns. He sports  a dark gray trench-coat with black buttons, a black long spiked collar around his neck and two opal earrings with silver lining. Around his tail are tail belts with light blue buckles and black huntress boots with light blue buckles on the side.

== Personality ==
Being the commander for one of the largest armies, Cassian is a strict and disciplined individual, though is seen as a reasonable figure of authority by the soldiers that work under his name. He often has a stoic nature and expresses little to no remorse or emotions when on or off duty and is often seen with a straight, monotone face while speaking a slightly expressive tone. A ruthless man, Cassian has demonstrated to be merciless and often kills people in cold blood with little to no regret, perceiving the people he murders as as nothing but targets for him, including people he has to capture. he is described by his trainees as both dead calm, yet incredibly intimidating; his presence alone is able to stir up fear in even the bravest individuals because of how high his position is and how intense his strength and abilities are.     

Though, despite his stoic and intimidating deposition, Cassian has shown to be quick to anger and often resorts to physical or verbal violence when a soldier cocks up during battle or training, leading to rather strained relationships with the people he works with, as seen when he had punched Akuji in the gut for befriending a hybrid. However, Cassian has shown devoted loyalty towards the king and Lyakon, being the kings right-hand man and speaking in a considerably softer tone while being rather intimidated but fascinated by his presence. Because of his devoted loyalty, he is sometimes perceived as an extremist in a political sense, thinking that only one individual should hold the power from the people and is often in extreme support for any of his kingdoms actions, even if they stir up controversy in Azuren, Lyakon's nemesis.    

Cassian has demonstrated to have a warped view of justice. He perceives justice depending on what side he sets on, thus explaining his implied abuse towards Akuji. With Lyakon's justice system being corrupt, he often follows what his kingdom thinks ideologically. He is mainly described as not having a mind of his own and is constantly believing what the kingdom believes and not having his own set of beliefs, as Ashton describes Cassian as "nothing but a brainless commander" because he believes what the others believe and works as the kings commander, further fueling his point about him not having a mind of his own.       

Being the youngest in his fleet, Cassian has demonstrated to be mature and does not talk much unless he is engaging in combat. He is usually cautious with his words and his choice of words are described as meticulous, yet intimidating when speaking. He has been shown to be fluent in many languages, mainly Kazakh, Russian, and English, but has a difficult time pronouncing some english words with "r" as he has a difficult time pronouncing "information" or any other word that is similar. Cassian has a disdain for people teasing him, such as when Akuji calls him by "Cassi," a nickname his father called him as a child, but does not retaliate due to Akuji being the right-hand man and frequently faces threats if he attempts to get physical with Akuji.          

However, he is also cautious when doing ground work, and is sometimes described as overly paranoid when even setting foot on dirt. Due to his father dying from a land-mine accident, Cassian has a fear of stepping on one and ending up in the same condition his father had by dying. His fear of land-mines causes him to become extremely vulnerable because he did not want to end up like his father and have his mother and siblings grieving over him. Akuji often taunts him for this fear, making him visibly more vulnerable and shaken up when a land-mine is ever mentioned.           

Losing his father at a young age, he has demonstrated to miss having a father figure in his life, clinging to any figure of authority around him to feel a sense of love inside of his heart. He's protective if the paternal figures he has in his life and would often go as far in saying he would die for any of them because of his immense thought of his father dying after he stepped on a land mine. He is often teased for his paranoia by Akuji to an extent where he nearly punched him into a tree, demonstrating that his paranoia is great enough to extend into physical violence.            

Cassian is protective of both his soldiers and the earrings that he wears. Because of the earrings being the only item he has left of his father, he chooses to protect them more than himself, one time taking a bullet to the arm to solely protect his earrings. Though he sees people as only living targets, he still does everything he could to protect his soldiers in order to not get in quarrels with the king; Cassian strives for perfection from his soldiers because of how he would get into an argument if any of the soldiers had died under his wing. His obsession with perfection is shown with his moments when he trained Akuji, where he becomes arbitrarily more harsh and abusive since he could not reach the pinnacle the soldiers were expected to achieve.              

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilites:''' Being trained by his father and enlisting in the National Army at a young age, Cassian has shown to possess extreme strength and power at his age. Being the youngest commander in his fleet, he has demonstrated to be a danger to both Locaster's group and any other army. As he is the youngest commander, he is mostly underestimated due to his age. Even though Cassian is one of the youngest commanders in his fleet, he demonstrates to possess an extreme amount of strength that surpasses the older commanders in the other fleets, often being referred to as one of the king's best commander.     

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes :''' Cassian has proved to be an incredibly fast individual. He was able to quickly ambush and slam down Locaster into the ground without difficulty. It is noted by Ashton that Cassian's reaction times match the caliber of speed and reaction to that of a demon. With his fast reactions, he manages to both run at a fast ace while using his explosives and his gun. With his speed, his reflexes are equally as fast and was able to evade incoming attacks from both Ashton and Damion, despite the both of them being highly advanced  in military combat, with Ashton being a soldier and Damion previously being a lieutenant colonel.            

'''Enhanced Strength:''' Being the youngest commander in his fleet and previously being trained by his father, Cassian possesses strength that nearly matches the caliber of a demons, quickly knocking down Locaster after ambushing him and kicking down Ashton without any difficulty. Even with the efforts of both Damion and Shay combined, Cassian managed to quickly overpower them with a simple punch.             

'''Enhanced Durability:''' Cassian possesses enhanced durability and has an exceptionally durable body, being able to withstand many of Yuna's poisons that she assimilated into his body. His durability is also shown when Locaster used his shadow vines in order to try and pierce him and had difficulty doing so, as he had to get Ashton to assist him shortly after.             

'''Enhanced Agility:''' Cassian has shown to be very quick and agile, being able to pass through a lush forest effortlessly and evading both Locaster and Yuna's attacks. When fighting, Cassian often relies on his speed and sometimes his acrobatic movements in order to deliver an attack or ambush another individual. His agility had surprised Nabi and the rest of the group members due to having trouble with keeping up with his moves.             

'''Enhanced Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' As a commander, Cassian has shown to have both high stamina and endurance, mainly due to being under harsh training for around thirteen years. He was able to stay up once after being attacked by multiple sword stabs and lightning strikes, only coming back with minor injuries. This is shown in his small encounter with Locaster when the two of them had went head on, which despite all of his injuries, manages to stay up without having to rest or be healed.             

'''Keen Intellect:''' Cassian possesses an incredible amount of knowledge on both combat and warfare. He has been described by the other commanders as extremely erudite and clever, utilizing his weapons and planning out the next attack in a matter of seconds without having to lose his composure. Being educated by many tutors from the kingdom and his father, he is able to sense if people are in an area minutes after stepping onto the ground, being able to locate Locaster within a matter of seconds.               

'''Bilingual:''' Coming from Kazakh and Greek origin, Cassian has demonstrated to be bilingual, speaking all Russian, Kazakh, and English effortlessly. Though, he has a difficult time pronouncing some english words with the letter "r." Cassian has also been seen speaking Greek, but he cannot speak it well due to his Kazakh accent. He mainly speaks a combination of Russian and Kazakh but speaks English when engaging in battle or in normal conversations between him and his soldiers.               

== Equipment ==
'''Double Barreled Shotgun:''' Cassian harbors a double barreled shotgun, which he uses in order to shoot down targets from afar. Because he was never fond of using a sword, he opted for a gun because of his experience with handling firearms better than he can with melee weapons.                 

'''Miniature Grenades:''' Cassian possesses miniature grenades that have the capability of creating massive explosions that can cause immense damage. He carries them mainly in his coat pockets and uses them when having to chase down Locaster by throwing them in potential areas where he would have been able to escape.                  

== Weaknesses ==
'''Landmines:''' Though Cassian is suited to be in more dangerous missions, he has shown to have a severe fear and paranoia of landmines. This is shown when having to adjust onto the forest grounds and taking careful steps whenever running because of his fear of ending up like his father had due to him stepping on a landmine overseas and dying. Because of his fear of landmines, some of his abilities get hindered greatly all due to a fear he has.  

== Relationships ==

=== [[Akuji Hasegawa]] ===
Akuji was one of Cassian's many trainees and was ordered to train him under his wing when he was fourteen. Cassian proves to have a seething hatred towards Akuji, abusing him for not giving an exemplar performance and often demanded beyond perfection from him. When he proved to be a capable soldier, Cassian allowed Akuji to work with him under his wing when he grew older, but Akuji exemplifies insensitive behavior towards Cassian, calling him by the nickname "Cassi," despite him not wanting to be called by that nickname and also teasing him for his fear of landmines and his fathers death. Due to Akuji being the king's right hand man, he cannot retaliate with physical violence towards him out of fear of being penalized. 

Akuji shows a remote liking towards Cassian, but only does so to see his reaction whenever taunting him, ripping off his earring once and making him fight for him to give it back before Cassian nearly smothered him. He demonstrates his dislike by punching him in the gut in private or using physical violence to warp fear into him when they are not on kingdom grounds. He often yearns for Akuji to someday die due to his cruel and lecherous behavior towards him, but often keeps his thoughts in private out of fear of Akuji ever knowing them. 

Cassian also harbors an immense amount of hatred for Akuji solely due to him making remarks about his dead father in a more crude manner, often causing him to lash out to an extent where he will get physical with Akuji.   

=== [[Ashton Khanh]] ===
Most of Cassian's interactions with Ashton are limited, as the two never interacted with one another. Though, Ashton did work in Cassian's fleet and demonstrated to have a somewhat decent relationship with him, despite Cassian's cruel nature. He was often praised by Cassian more than he had praised Akuji, something Akuji later points out during their fight to get Ashton back to Lyakon. Yet, despite his praise for him, he holds an immense grudge against Ashton for betraying Lyakon and leaving the kingdom. 

Cassian perceives Ashton in a neutral light, not seeing him as an entirely terrible person, but not seeing him as a good one either. His neutrality on him is further proven when he would not take his side of the story and only does what the kingdom ever so thinks. 

=== [[Locaster Helios]] ===
Locaster and Cassian's interactions are limited. However, when the both of them meet during the battle against the Lyakonian soldiers, he has shown to be impressed with Locaster's magical abilities and combats, being genuinely delighted when going up against him but still maintaining his harsh, cold disposition. Locaster has shown to be fearful of him because of his menacing aura and how he was able to send a fear strong enough to let his guard down.  

=== [[Damion Halloreen]] ===
The interactions between Damion and Cassian are also limited. However, when Damion came to protect Locaster in a hugging embrace position, Cassian lowered his guard due to how he was protecting his son made him reminisce about him and his father. Their relationship gave a sense of envy inside of Cassian because of how his father was still alive and his was not. He perceived Damion and his son as him and his father when he was younger.  

== Trivia ==

* Cassian is also one of the many characters who does not like British people, alongside Ashton. Though, Ashton displays a hatred for them, Cassian seems to tolerate them to an extent. 
* Cassian is also one of the many characters who's hair is tied into a braid, the others being [[Akuji Hasegawa]], [[Misaya Myat]], and the Founding Demon, Shizuko. 
* Despite having a mother who is a conductor, he never learned how to play an instrument and does not excel at playing any for that matter.
* Cassian's favorite foods are Shelpek, curry rice and manti, but dislikes anything that contains fish, with the exceptions being salmon and tuna.
* Despite Akuji mostly working with him, Cassian shows to have a sense of hostility around him.

Hi {{Username}}, I'm Galaxy, and I'm a sleep-deprived writer who is totally mentally stable and does not belong in an asylum. I go by any pronouns.

I've technically been using this wiki for a while on my old account, but I moved here as of 2023, upon reaching 1k edits. Anyways, I won't really be active here anymore, but I'll still come back every once in a while, comment on posts, see what's new, and check if this place has revived itself (impossible challenge). 

Also, please don't go hunting for my old stories from when I was, what, 10?, because I will literally eat your vital organs. 

---  

With that being said, I have to thank all my old wiki friends for the great memories I've made from this place. This is where I first truly started enjoying the craft of writing, where I learned to be inclusive and respectful, where I learned to take criticism. This is where I spent my time during the pandemic, and actually made some friends during those times when I was stuck at home and my mental health went down faster than the global economy. 

--- 

If you have questions about the wiki or writing, want to ask for general life help (be warned: I have dollar-store advice ready and waiting to throw at you like a sack of wet mice) or just want someone to talk to, you can do so on my message board. You can also find me in the server Discord by the same name.

Thank you for making it this far down the page and I apologise for wasting your time with my horrible sense of humour. All of you guys are beautiful humans who do not deserve the world for the cold, cruel place it is (unless you're yet another piece of crap, in which case, please take it). I wish you all a great day, wherever you may live.

Nabi yet again because it didnt work last time.png|Drawing
Nabi cutie.png|Animal Jam
&lt;/gallery&gt;}}

'''Nabi Haluška''' is a major supporting character in a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. She is affiliated with [[Locaster Helios|Locaster's]] group and is the wielder of the insect shard, and is the youngest shard user out of all of the other users, with [[Fēng Xu|Fēng]], who is the second youngest shard user in the group. 

== History ==
Nabi is the daughter of an Elverian medical officer who often assisted him in the medical field, though before she was a florist when working with her mother. As she was trained to be a medical assistant, she was often away with her father and spent less time with her mother, though the both of them still had a strong relationship. However, as time started to pass, her mother had fallen ill and it left her unable to not function properly. As a result, Nabi decided to stay home to assist her mother while learning how to take care of herself. 

As her mother's illness began to worsen, Nabi had missed school in order to take care of her mother while her father was away, knowing that she will grow worse without any care. Due to her father's job, he was busy to an extent where he would not see his family in months. Her mother had remained bedridden after the illness had began to take over parts of her body, making it difficult for her to do basic tasks and as a result, Nabi managed to take care of her and made sure she was doing well. 

One day when her father came home, he had brought Nabi two purple gemstones back after he was away due to assisting soldiers in the medical tents. He had retrieved them from a nearby cave when going to fetch water, and gave them to Nabi as a token of appreciation, and apologized for not being there to help her. Because of her mother's sickness, he retired from his job and tended to his wife, with Nabi returning to school the following day. 

Nabi had taken the shards and placed them on a helmet she crafted when she was younger, and decided to wear it because of how the color of the shards made it stand out. However, she soon began to notice that her shards would attract insects and other creatures like spiders. She also recalled having small spiderwebs grow on her hands before learning how to control her powers. Seeing that the shards on her helmet had such unique abilities, Nabi begun to practice with trying to maintain her abilities. 

== Appearance ==

=== Drawing ===
Nabi is a young girl with a slender build and tan complexion with mute red lips. She has light purple eyes with long, brown hair that extends to her upper back with purple highlights present internally. 

Nabi wears a bird-like helmet that has two large insect shards attached on the side, aswell as a black cloak wrapped around her body. She also sported a black spiked necklace that had silver spikes around it. She wears light purple armor with various flower designs, mute purple military sweatpants and light purple boots with darker laces. She sometimes carries a medical box incase of an emergency. 

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Nabi's Animal Jam Model is a fox with a purple outer fur and tan underbelly. She has light purple eyes and flower patterns all over her fur. 

Nabi's attire is similar to that of her drawing counterpart: She dons an epic feathered helmet with a black cloak wrapping around her body. She wears a black spiked collar that wraps around her neck. Nabi also sports a blackout diamond encrusted tail and hunter boots. 

== Personality ==
Nabi has been described by her peers as energetic and lively, yet spunky and always looking for adventure and has an interest in medicine and machines. Being the daughter of a medical officer and florist, she has shown to excel in both the medical and floral field, being able to tend to Ashton's wounds after Cassian had punched him in the face when being thrown in Lyakon's prison. She often has a sharp mouth, usually saying things that are considered rather surprising considering her age and frequently teases members of the group in a playful manner. With her playfulness, Nabi is described to be a very kind and comedic girl, having the ability to keep the mood up with a few simple jokes.  

Being the youngest shard user, Nabi has demonstrated to be responsible with using her powers, though she sometimes relies on them too much. She improves this by using her physical capabilities more than her magic, keeping them both at an equal balance to the best of her ability. She is prone to falling ill if being separated from her shards for too long and often has to keep her helmet on at all times or having to keep one of her shards near her, something that Nabi has a strong dislike of doing. She can at times be stubborn, refusing to change sides or her mind for the sake of her friends and is persistent in doing so.     

Despite being thirteen, Nabi has demonstrated to be an excellent fighter and acts rather brash and headstrong when in combat while also possessing leadership skills when doing so, ordering everyone in the group to split up to fight the Lyakonian soldiers when they were discovered. She can appear as both hot-blooded and rather abrasive, oftentimes losing her temper because of insults made at her or her friends and is quick to come to their defense at any moment. She has also proven that she too is an excellent coordinator with the assistance of Locaster and Shay.                   

== Abilities ==
'''Overall Abilities:''' As the youngest shard user in the group, Nabi has shown to be an extremely talented and powerful fighter. Despite being the shortest member of the group and not having much strength, she manages to make up for it by using her insect-like abilities in order to assist her during battles. She was able to swiftly out-pace many of the Lyakonian soldiers and nearly went one on one with Akuji, but had quickly backed down due to him running after Ashton instead after he was sent to help Nabi with taking down more of the soldiers. With her previous knowledge as a medical officer, she has proven to be one of the best healers in the group, right besides [[Yuna Hanamura|Yuna]] and [[Cherry Amana|Cherry]].    

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Nabi is extremely fast, being able to vanish within a blink of an eye when running away from enemies or soldiers. She was able to out-pace Akuji and his fleet of soldiers effortlessly and quickly climbing on a tree in order to use her powers to get everyone away from the soldiers, and has the capability of attacking them before they can register what happened. Her rather superhuman-like speed caught the eyes of Ashton, witnessing her unleash dozen of strikes onto them and has been described to be the third fastest member in the group.     

'''Enhanced Strength:''' Despite not being the strongest, Nabi has demonstrated to have incredible strength, as proven when she was able to pick up Fēng and carry her on her back when in the rain for a little while and managing to nearly punch Akuji, almost landing a hit but was thrown off of him after. She was able to take down many soldiers with a simple punch or kick and also dragging Crow across the ground after he returns again.       

'''Enhanced Durability:'''  Being in the medical unit and working in harsh conditions, Nabi's body has proven to be incredibly durable: She exemplifies this when being able to work through her overuse of her shards magic and having her arm nearly cut off. She was able to keep fighting despite her injury.        

'''Enhanced Stamina &amp; Endurance:''' Nabi possesses enhanced stamina and endurance, almost never getting tired and being able to stay in the same shape when fighting. In their battle with Crow after he returns, she managed to continue fighting him despite all the injuries she had received and landed many injuries on him, leaving him surprised despite having the power of The Dark Entity. She managed to hold off Akuji for a brief amount of time before he switched targets.          

'''Insect Communication:''' As an insect shard user, Nabi is able to communicate with the insects around her, allowing her to command them to do what she desires. She is seen communicating with a spider to quickly alert the others spiders to make a large web in order to trap some of the black vines in to prevent them from spreading further to the port. She has also proven to get along with insects well, regardless of how poisonous or dangerous they may seem.          

'''Keen Intellect:''' Nabi possesses a vast amount on knowledge in medicine, insects and the demon gems. During the battle to escape Lyakon, she was able to calculate how many soldiers would have been coming at them and devised a plan to evacuate them from the castle. She has also proven to know where every kingdom is due to remembering their coordinates, leading the group to Misterin in order to claim asylum from Lyakon, who held them in custody.           

== Magic Abilities ==
'''Insect Manipulation:''' Nabi is able to manipulate insects in any form she desires. She is able to summon many of them in the palm of her hand to call for them, along with being able to spawn insects inside of a person based on her internal emotions.

I felt bad because they were new so i buddied them and then they started spam sending me jags that read: "come to my den!" i went to there den and then i noticed there avatar was bloody with that red splosh pattern. there username was a new jammer and now it had become leftalone1. i was scared, so I logged off. when i logged back on it said incorrect password so I checked the parent tools and it was changed to a weird random line of numbers, it was like 434325345345 or something like that. I never saw leftalone1 until one day a random jammer named sad182 kept spamming jags that read: "come to my den!" this was clearly an alt account of leftalone1. nothing weird happened after that.

'''Cherry Amana''' is a major supporting character in a Good vs Evil Roleplay. She is a spellcaster and healer in training. She and her sister had to escape from their village after the Black Sun attacked it, forcing them into hiding in order for them not to get found and captured. She’s currently on an ongoing quest with her friend Locaster and his friends to make the demon gems whole again before the black vines destroy Azuren.
== &lt;big&gt;History&lt;/big&gt; ==
Cherry was the eldest daughter of Luna Amana, the finest archer in their home of Dawnbloom Village. She never got to meet her father ever since she was born, and her mother kept telling her that he left the family, showing little to no care for him. At a young age, Cherry was very interested in herbs and healing, even watching other people doing magic during a spell class. 

Cherry was, as Luna would describe, an eager and kind child who wanted to learn new things. She noted that her sister was her whole world, wanting to protect her no matter what the circumstances were. However, Cherry was also shy and rather timid, not wanting to be the center of attention for a prolonged period of time. Noticing her rather shy demeanor, Luna decided to teach Cherry the basics of healing magic and became proficient at it. Cherry decided to secretly watch spell classes through the window to learn how to do spells because of her shyness. 

Cherry eventually learned how to shrink objects and do basic healing, practicing every moment she got and became proficient at it. She also taught her sister, Windflower, a little of what she knew. One day, Cherry noticed how Windflower was practicing using a sword, and decided to help her by using a shrinking spell to shrink the sword to a good size for them. She even managed to customize the swords for the two of them, their names in Latin engraved in the blade of the swords.  

Cherry would start to practice sword fighting in the training room with Windflower for days at a time and found an enjoyment practicing with her sister. One night, cherry noticed that her mother was sneaking out of her bedroom and saw her telling Windflower about something. She did get caught, and later on found out that their father was evil after he left the family. 

Cherry also tried to spend time with Luna as well, begging her to show her how she would shoot targets using her bow. This led to her learning how to use the basics of a bow, but in fighting combat she would mainly use her sword. She also tried to ask about what happened to their father multiple times, with Luna telling her over and over that he just left the family. This left Cherry feeling frustrated, not knowing what actually happened to her father.

However, things started to take a drastic turn when the Black Sun, a terrorist military group, invaded Dawnbloom Village in the early hours of the morning. Cherry was forced to flee, along with her sister, but were attacked by a Black Sun soldier. Luna managed to defend them, and after a lot of back and forth, told Cherry and Windflower to run from the village and never look back. Cherry didn’t want to leave her mother behind, but listened to Luna as they ran from the only place they called home. She never saw her mother again after that, leaving her with some form of regret, wondering what would happen if she stayed and helped her fight.

When she was seven years old, Cherry was forced to hide from the Black Sun for the rest of her childhood. She would practice using the spells she knew and look for new herbs and plants when the soldiers were not patrolling the area. She and Wind both had very little amounts of gold from their rushed escape, only buying food when they had the chance to. Cherry, at one point, even tried testing plants if they were edible. This went on for many years until she woke up one day to realize her sister was gone. This made her panic, her first thought being if the Black Sun captured Windflower. She spent multiple days and months looking for her sister while hiding from the Black Sun to avoid being captured.

One day, Cherry realized that her sister was in a special group, Team Voltage, a group who fights against any evil forces and saves people from harm. She was finally found by none other than her sister Windflower and after an awkward introduction, was allowed to join the group, becoming their next healer in place of Windflower. 

She went on many many missions with the group, one of them involving a realm where her sister had an evil counterpart named Lily. But, the leader of the group, Bolt, one day disbanded the team after there was a huge argument between everyone in the group. This forced Cherry, Windflower, Soul, and Locaster to isolate themselves from the Black Sun as they slowly tried to take over the world.

== Appearance ==
(Note: This character has two appearances; An Animal Jam model, and a Gacha Club model. The Gacha CLub model is supposed to give a more accurate sense of what they would look like as a person, and not in Animal Jam. The Animal Jam model and the Gacha Club model are used to show them both in Animal Jam and as an actual person)

=== Gacha Club Model ===
Cherry is a young adult who is around 5’5, making her the shortest out of everyone in the group. She has pale skin with cherry red hair in a braid, and teal eyes. 

Being a spellcaster, she carries two small pouches around her waist full of her herb supplies. She  has a book that explains some of the herbs she has seen and what they do.

Her normal outfit includes a dark raspberry top and skirt with dark red highlights. She also wears a scarf hiding the necklace she made with her sister Windflower when they were little kids. Cherry also wore two hair clips in her hair to keep her bangs in place. She wore high knee white and raspberry boots.

=== Black Sun Outfit ===
During her imprisonment in the Black Sun by Shizuka Ikami, she wore a black and gray uniform similar to her normal attire. However, on her top there was a heavy piece of armor as a chest piece, and had a long sleeved shirt with gloves. Also, she wore gray leggings under her skirt to cover up her legs. Cherry was also forced to take off her hair clips and was stripped of her necklace, replacing her scarf with a short black one. 

=== Animal Jam Model ===
Cherry’s animal jam mode is a cerise coloured wolf with a white underbelly and white fire markings. Her usual attire has her carrying a sword on her back, along with wearing a red ribbon scarf around her neck and a dark red butterfly in her hair.

== Personality ==
As a child, Cherry was extremely shy towards the other villagers and children, not knowing what to say and scared about what they would think of her. But, she also had a kind heart. After learning the basics of healing magic, she would try to heal injured animals that she saw while out hunting for herbs in the nearby forest. That would sometimes lead her to get attacked. She also was suspicious of her mother for a while since she thought she was hiding something from her and Windflower. 

After Luna’s sacrifice and her escaping the village, Cherry's personality started to shift from a shy and kind girl to a more traumatized and paranoid one because of her mother's sacrifice. She started to become mature at a young age, teaching how to fend for herself and her sister, but also became overly cautious. As the Black Sun was still looking for them, she often had a paranoia that the Black Sun would eventually track her and her sister down, leading to her protective demeanor she has now over Windflower. 

In the present, Cherry is a rather protective and slightly hostile individual, protecting her sister and often acts defensive when talking about people she’s close with. She has shown this when Veena was talking about how Cherry was overprotective with her sister, and she argued back saying that she was doing it ever since she lost her mother years ago. Yet, despite her stubborn demeanor, she shows to have a more kind and caring side towards her friends. She tries her best to help all her friends in the group since she was a healer, but it sometimes leads to her making impulsive decisions. 

== Abilities ==
'''Herb Intellect:''' Out of everyone (except Yuna), she knows which herbs to use for spells and which are for healing. However, this doesn’t mean she knows what every single herb in the world is, she only knows which ones she has seen before or has used in a spell.

'''Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:''' Despite being captured by the Black Sun, it did help her with her fighting skills. When Cherry gets really mad about one of her enemies badly hurting her sister or friends, her speed and reflexes increases. This is only activated when she gets really angry. It only goes away once she calms down, but there’s a chance for her to become reckless and not think about strategy at all when this happens.

'''Enhanced Strength:''' Cherry has shown to have a lot more strength in doing spells and while in a fight. She can last much longer while holding a spell than her sister. She has also shown to be able to throw people a few metres away from her, like when she fought the guards while helping her friends escape from [[Akuji Hasegawa]] and [[Cassian Packard]]. However, she does still get weak from overuse. 
== Magic Abilities ==
'''Healing:''' Cherry is able to heal wounds using her magic. So far in her training she can heal scrapes, cuts, and deep wounds depending on their size. The larger the wound, the more focus it takes and longer it takes to heal completely. She can also heal anyone in a certain radius if she concentrates hard enough.

'''Spirit magic:''' After a conversation with Locaster about her magic reacting to the darkness vines, the two of them made a theory that her healing magic might be combined with spirit magic. She was told that a piece of the wind gem plus healing magic created spirit magic. Cherry tried multiple times to try to destroy the darkness vine that Polaris had in a jar, but failed. It was only until the darkness vine morphed into a big breathing plant that she finally was able to use her magic to destroy it, However, this is a big risk because it takes up almost all of her energy, depending on the size of the darkness root.  

'''Potion making:''' Cherry has shown to sometimes make potions on the fly or beforehand as a safety measure in case her spells fail, seen when she made a healing potion when her magic wasn’t working very well. She even tries to experiment and create potions without knowing what they do. Cherry was the one that made the base of a potion to stop her sister's evil counterpart from taking over Wind's body completely.  

'''Teleportation spell:''' Cherry has the spell that allows her to teleport: However, she can only teleport a certain radius and cannot spam the spell, which would result in fatigue-like symptoms and dizziness. 

'''Perception spell:''' During her time studying, Cherry learns a perception spell that can help her detect anyone in a certain radius. In order to work the spell, she must concentrate intensely to find any one she's detecting or the spell will break. She has proven to be vulnerable when performing the spell because of the intense focus it requires. 

'''Shrinking spell:''' Using a dew leaf and a chant, Cherry is able to shrink objects to a size she so desires. However, she must crush the dew leaf and place or throw it in the direction of the person or object. She only used this spell once when she was a kid, using it to customize two swords for her and Wind.  

'''Invisibility spell:''' Eat a small handful of birch bark and hold onto anyone or object to turn you and them invisible. You must focus on keeping the spell going until the threat goes away.  The amount of time you can stay invisible depends on the strength of the user.  

'''Temporary barrier:''' Cherry is able to create a temporary barrier around her or another person that can last multiple hits at once. However, the amount of durability the barrier can handle depends on her strength. Cherry has used her barrier spell on many occasions, one example being when she was helping her friends fight Sheba, their friend Blyeth's evil true form.  

== Equipment ==
'''Sword:''' Cherry when she was a little kid, decided to personalize two Dawnbloom swords for her and her sister Windflower. This was a medium sized weapon she used to fight in most of her battles. She usually switches between using spells and using her sword in different scenarios.

'''Crimson Bow:''' Though she rarely uses it, she does know how to use a bow. The only times she has used it was when she was trying to hunt animals when she was hiding from the Black Sun.

== Weaknesses ==
'''Overuse:''' Just like other demons and magic users, one of her main weaknesses is overuse of her magic, either her healing powers or spells. Since her bigger or longer spells take more energy, if she uses them for too long she will become very dizzy and even collapse from exhaustion. 

'''Overprotectiveness:''' After losing her mother, she has become overprotective of her little sister, Windflower. Cherry is constantly with her anywhere she goes to ensure that she is protected from harm in any shape or form. When the two of them are separated, she worries about her so much that she loses focus and panics, nervous about the thought of losing the last connection to her family. 

'''PTSD:''' Cherry is prone to having horrible flashbacks of when she was captured by the Black Sun whenever they are mentioned or when she sees someone in a situation reminding her of her capture. She also gets flashbacks from when her mother had sacrificed herself in order to save her and her sister.

'''Easy to Anger:''' Cherry's main weak point is her anger; She has shown to get angered or offended during a conversation about her sister or in a big argument. Cherry has to try to stay calm and resolve the argument when Bolt was threatening to disband Team Voltage many years ago. Cherry also got very angry when Veena told her that she was overprotective of Windflower, leading to an argument. Cherry also can lose her temper around enemies when they harm her friends or sister. Although, Cherry learned to control her anger slowly but surely. 

== Relationships ==

=== Windflower Amana ===
Cherry and Wind have had a sisterly sibling bond ever since they were kids, taking care and trying to protect each other til the very end. They even fight in a duo just like Yuna and Shay Hanamura, with Cherry using her sword, and Wind using her powers. The two of them eventually made a discovery that they can use their swords together in a wind spin attack in a fight.

Ever since they had to escape from their village, Cherry and Wind had to rely on each other in order to survive. This was when Cherry actually taught Wind more basic spells she can use along with her magic. One of them would go out safely for herbs for food, while the other would protect the cave they were sheltered in and keep a lookout for Black Sun members. Then every hour they would teleport back to the cave and report their progress.

=== Luna Amana ===
Cherry had a close bond with her mother, as she was taught how to do basic healing from her in the first place. Luna was also the one to encourage her into spell casting when she noticed her watching spell classes from the window. Many years before the events of the roleplay, Cherry somewhat felt like Luna was hiding something after she found out her father was evil, but shrugged it off.

During the main events of the roleplay, Cherry still had Luna’s words she told her about her father, making her wonder about who her father really was. Cherry kept trying to forget what happened to Luna and the sacrifice she made to save her and Windflower, but every little thing mentioned about the Black Sun would trigger that flashback moment. To make things worse, her memories of being captured by [[Shizuka Ikami]] of the Black Sun would also trigger if it was mentioned as well. 

=== Kazimieras Easton ===
When Cherry was born, she never had the opportunity to meet her father. All she knew from her mother was that he was an evil man that left the family for an unknown reason. 

=== Soul Kawasaki ===
Way before Team Voltage was disbanded, Cherry and Soul kinda had an on and off friendship with each other because of how opposite his personality was to hers and Wind's. it was only until after he admitted that he liked her sister was when they started to have a close friendship. The three of them made an amazing trio during missions with fighting, with Cherry healing, and her sister and Soul fighting together as the offense. While they were isolated from the others, they still were close friends but had a wedge in between them because of Cherry's growing overprotectiveness. They still cared for each other, like when Cherry was worried about Soul when he didn't come back from visiting Ashton in Lyakon. She only found out what really happend to him during Locaster and the other's fight against [[Cassian Packard]] and [[Akuji Hasegawa]], where Cassian told Loc in his own way that he was killed. Cherry, who was hiding during that time, had to keep her feelings in so that she wouldn't get caught. After freeing them and escaping together was when she finally had time to grieve for her old friend. 

=== Locaster Helios ===
Loc was the first person to trust Cherry when she first joined the group Team Voltage many years ago. 



== Trivia ==

* Cherry fangirls over [[Yuna Hanamura]] when she watches her make potions, wanting to learn spells and making potions from her,
* Despite being half Polish and half Latvian, she’s more on her father’s side, who is Latvian.
* Cherry’s original age used to be fifteen before it was changed to nineteen.
* Cherry rarely kept her hair down, mostly because it would get in her face and might be a hassle while doing spells.
* Cherry’s father was originally going to be part of the Black Sun, but instead said that he left the family because he was evil.
* The chants in some of the spells Cherry uses is in latvian, her language. 
* Cherry is more of a defensive fighter than an offense fighter.
* Cereza in spanish means cherry.
* The inspiration for Cherry's discovery on the combination of healing and spirit magic is from this show called The Legend of Korra
* Back when I created Cherry, I at first named her after the colour i made her animal model. Which was a cherry red colour. Then it was because of her cherry red hair in her human model.

'''Azuren''' is a country in the world of Lyakvat and is also the main setting of a Good Vs. Evil Roleplay. It is one of the worlds many countries and the largest out of all of them, being a transcontinental country that borders Lyarik to the east near its southern desolates and Soraya to its eastern forest. 

Historically, Azuren had many troubles of who had full control over the land. Many tribes that were created used to rule peacefully, but had troubles with trying to control the rest of the land, which were owned by other tribes besides their own, specifically demon tribes that had begun to travel to find a safer place. As a result, the disputes over the land caused the war between humans and demons, resulting in discrimination in demons and how they had managed to win against the tribes. The tribes, realizing that no one could truly own the land, decided to unite the areas they once controlled and made Azuren, also known by them as the "Azure Land." The tribes had continued to rule for a long time before disbanding.

Azuren has faced rapid industrialization, leading to a technological renaissance for a short period of time. However, during their renaissance also came many wars and a decline in their spirituality, along with more imperialist ambitions and motives. With their new motives set, they went on to take over Lyarik, which was then called Illyria, and many other nations prior, causing many conflicts and wars, including between the kingdoms. 

== History ==

=== Creation ===
Azuren was said to be created by the sun goddess, Uma, and the moon god, Callisto, after merging together to become what is now the world of Lyakvat in order to grant the wish of making a land that would bring peace and prosperity. When they merged, many tribes from an island that was surrounded by only water began migrating over to the new world that was created, the main ones being the Orisians, the Skuas, the Alokans, and the Shias. As tribes begun to settle, they each claimed a portion of the land and made a treaty between all four tribes, saying that they cannot conquer more land from other tribes in the area and that all are equal. 

The treaty was in effect for fifteen years after the creation of Azuren before the Shias, one of the many tribes, had started to expand their territories unbeknownst to the other tribes. the Alokans, one of the Shias ally tribes, had noticed the expansion on the land and alerted the other members. When alerted, the tribes suddenly got into a conflict with the Shias for taking over other tribes land. The leader of the Shias, angered that the Alokan leader had betrayed them, annulled the treaty and begun taking over more of the land. 

=== Troubles between the Tribes ===
As the Shias begun to take over, the four other tribes still stuck by the treaty that they created. Tensions between the Shias and the Alokans were starting to arise, but the Orisians and Skua's attempted to calm things down, even threatening to launch an attack on the Shias, resulting in them backing down from the Alokans. The conflict further erupted when the Shias begun to take over tribes owned by demons, who had settled within the northern territories in order to start a new life, causing a war between the humans and demons. Because of the severe conflict, the other tribes were forced to intervene because of the mass damage coming towards their land. Because of the magic and powers demons possessed, the demons subsequently won the war and defeated the tribes, even their most advanced warriors.

Upholding the shame of the defeat, the tribes suddenly harbored an immense hatred for the demons, despite them only fighting off the tribes to keep control of their land. As the tribes had vanished, the conflict further arose and the other tribes had also broken off the treaty, fighting over the land and attempting to claim leadership. The Orisians and the Skuas had started to fight with one another, leading to chaos with the other tribes. Three other tribes would fight over the northern land and the others fought for the other parts in order to gain power. As the conflict started to worsen, the tribes started to decrease in population and the occupation of the land started to effect the tribes because of the constant wars.    

As the wars begun to continue, three other tribes were fighting over land in northern Azuren and having the same problems as the other tribes were having.

Hi! My name's Amina, and welcome to my profile! I've been playing Animal Jam (AJ) since 2017, and I still go on aj to this day to roleplay and hang out with my online friends. I made my first article as a collab with my friend Auryze using a character I made named Cherry. I might do more in the future once I get all the info I need for my characters and have motivation to do it.

I'm actually a part of my friend's story, check out his profile to see more info. 

== Hobbies/interests ==

* Video games; I'm a nintendo switch gamer that loves to play as a form of entertainment
* Writing; I started to make a few stories in the setting of some of the games i've played in September 2022 . (ex; Splatoon 3, miitopia)

== School Sabertooth ==
You never realize what goes wrong until it does.

Now let’s start simple here. I’ve played Animal Jam since 2014, right before the golden era. As of today, I’ve played for 7 years, on August 22nd, 2021 but I’ve never really encountered anything like this. Yeah sure, I’ve heard of Fman and Wretchedjungle stealing your items, but I was never really rare. They never scared me.

However, in my area, we have local myths. I’d never worried about them until today. For context, there is a place in my area, that around the time I joined the game on mobile, Play Wild, I’d been sent to. I’ve gotten some odd Jam-a-grams from a buddy I’ve been concerned about involving similar aspects to the myths, but today really settled in why I was so unsettled. I’ve had this buddy since 2018, early 2018 to be exact.

About my local myth, the creatures are called the Wayward Bloodstealers, and they supposedly disguise themselves as people and run places that are supposedly for people who want good influences for their kids when they have mental health or behavioral issues. They’ll draw way too much blood in attempts to test you, but that gets debunked when you notice that kids there saw the vials from blood they drew from said kids, empty with a bit of residue, the person holding it often coming from the staff lounge or office. You’ll see why I mentioned these soon enough.

It had been a rough day at school, with kids going crazy, but it WAS the first day after all. My friend, who had went to the place the myth originated from recently, had stated there had been a staff member asking what I liked. They apparently wanted to hear all about me since xe had mentioned me in a “therapy” session. They are a big information sharer. Xe mentions things way too much, and is deemed a “Basic TMI Reminder kid” by my school. We’re teenagers, by the way. My friend in question is 15 and I am also 15. We are sophomores.

I thought nothing of it until I logged onto Animal Jam to receive a buddy request. It was a pink sabertooth with sea star glasses (the pink variant), and a couple other items I can’t quite recall. I accept most buddy requests, so I buddied them. They asked me to go to a school RP with them. Nothing much, right?

I couldn’t really tell you much about the start, just a normal school. They were a bit of a clingy buddy. I got a Jam-a-gram from the buddy I’ve been concerned about. “You should get off and unbuddy her.” They sent. I responded with a “Why?” but continued to rp. It got to the point when the School RP had a “Prom” of sorts, and the sabertooth asked me to teach her to dance. I said “Sure,” and taught her a couple moves in RP. My screen flashed for a couple of seconds, which I thought of as unusual. 

I got another Jam-a-Gram. “You’re safer offline. It’s looking for you. Unbuddy that sabertooth.” A bit ominous, but I supposed it was a joke. I kept doing the prom things as usual, before I noticed something off about the sabertooth model. The eyes were a blood red. It wasn’t an AJ color preset, so I thought she used the color coordinator. She was nonmember though. Maybe a glitch? She asked to dance with me. “I’m not sure if I want to do that,” I responded. My screen flashed with the words “DANCE WITH ME” in all caps, in a grotesque pink color, like that of uncooked meat.

One more Jam-a-Gram. “It’s been nice knowing you, pal.” I was shocked. How did my buddy know what was going on. I heard scratching outside, and looked out the window, but it was just our dog Princess wanting inside. Looking back at my screen, there was a bloody mess. My animal, a deer wearing blue furry arm cuffs, a RIM Jamaaliday gift ribbon, a blue flower crown, and ice armor, was doing the sleep emote in a pool of blood. There were rip marks from claws. Shutting off my tablet, I locked my door and closed the curtains of my window.

I couldn’t sleep that night. The next morning, I walked downstairs and was greeted by my mother. “You are not going to school today. There are reports that a seven year old girl had died by a mauling, found with no blood. Police said it looked like no animal they’ve ever seen.”

Taking the day, I opened up Animal Jam, curious to see if I had misremembered the night. I was using a different animal, my fox, which was one of the other three animals I had. I supposed I misremembered last night, until getting a Jam-a-gram from the concerning buddy. “I saw the news. Good job on staying alive.”

It was in that moment I realized that I had just survived the attack of what I hadn’t thought was real.

= ~Cats &amp; Dogs: A Tale of Romance and Cliche~ =
Not so long ago, cats and dogs lived in peace and harmony, until the cats became greedy and started a war with the dogs. 

They later won and ruled the land. While the cats were rich and threw parties almost everyday, the dogs lived in shabby houses in slums and had little money to live.

Having enough of her father planning marriages for her, Princess Cassidy escapes from her castle.

Maurice struggles from his poor family, and wishes one day the dogs can be separated from the evil cats’ rule.

When the two of them meet in the border in the forest one day, love will blossom and rules shall be broken.

==Ep.1 A Forbidden Crush==
Maurice: A brand new day, and I have to do my duties…things are kinda hard after that terrible war-oh why did I forget to introduce myself! I’m Maurice, an ordinary brown peasant dog in the town of Barksville. Me and my big brother Doug has been living here for years, and it does get a bit boring sometimes!

Doug: Brother! Where are you up to? Spying on the girls or pick mushrooms?

Maurice: Walking around, I’m bored.

Doug: Fine, do your own thing, but remember the mushrooms, they’re our dinner!

Maurice: (nods, then leaves)

[At the forest, Maurice sees a bunch of fancy-looking cats picking flowers, among them was a lovely purple mottled she-cat.]

Maurice: Princess Cassidy, my crush, yet we could never be together. Just look at me, I’m nothing but in rags while she’s a Princess!

[Camera turns to the flower-picking cats]

Sophie: Cass, you know it, Father wants you to marry someone and be queen soon.

Cassidy: But what if I don’t want to get married to someone I don’t even know! Who is the suitor this time?

Tabitha: Uh…it’s Sir Tauri, your majesty. There’s not so many options left since you’ve kicked out so many.

Cassidy: (slaps her own face) I said I don’t wanna get married!

Pepper: Well happy for you at least.

Cassidy: Do you even get what I mean? I thought Sophie’s the only one dumb here.

Sophie: Cass! Mind your words!

Fiona: Have you heard of the attacks from the other kingdoms? There’s a recent one last week.

Sophie: I hope your suitors don’t have to go to war for this.

Cassidy: (annoyed) I DON’T EVEN WANT A SUITOR!

[Maurice’s POV, peeking at the girls from the bushes nearby]

Maurice: Oh how I wish I could have gotten more closer to her…it’s just against the law to have any contact with a cat unless at war…(sighs)

[Scene changes to the Catanoia Royal Palace]

King Dusk: Cassidy dear, we need to talk.

Cassidy: Ugh! Yes?

King Dusk: Because of the attacks recently, I have to go out to lead the war-WHY ARE YOU LEAVING?

Cassidy: I don’t even care about you leaving, it’s just so tiresome that all I do are royal duties and suitors. I’m just tired, father, from all this.

King Dusk: It’s not an option, while I leave, you stay here to protect the kingdom.

[King Dusk leaves]

Cassidy: I hate my life.

Pepper: Anything wrong, your majesty?

Cassidy: Just…leave me alone.

[Maurice’s POV]

Maurice: You know Princess Cassidy’s getting married soon?

Dougie: So what?

Maurice: I don’t know, just feeling bad for her to be forced to marry someone she doesn’t know.

Dougie: Who even cares anyway, those cats killed our parents in the war! You know that! Get back in mushroom picking before the cat soldiers come and take us as slaves for war!

Maurice: Yes!

==Ep.2 The War of the Cats &amp; Dogs ==
Maurice: Doug, I’m back! Doug? Brother?

Dakota: He’s taken by the cats!

Maurice: WHAT?!

Honeycomb: And he won’t come back until the war’s over.

Maurice: (thinks) I need to find him. (Runs off)

[The battlefield, with lots of dead bodies. Maurice can still spot Dougie on the ground]

Maurice: DOUG! Please, don’t leave me here!

Hugo: What’s up with all this commotion?

Maurice: (in tears) Doug…he’s dead.

Spirit: Maurice! We’re supposed to stay at the village, now what?

Tala: Sir, we have to leave him be, that’s what the rules said.

Maurice: You can’t do this! He’s my brother, my best friend!

[Meanwhile]

Cassidy: Father, what have you done! Many have died in this war already! You’re not-

King Dusk: SHUT UP! Sir Tauri and several others are severely injured so we’re going to assign you a new husband, perhaps the last on the list: (sighs) Oleander the Timid…

Cassidy: Oleander?! No, not him! I only treat him like a friend, not a future husband! And are you insane? He’s literally two years younger than me! Do you just expect me to be a wife of a literal child?! I’m 18 already!

King Dusk: NO BUTS! YOU WILL MARRY HIM NEXT WEEK! DON’T YOU DARE RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME, YOUNG LADY!

[King Dusk leaves Cassidy’s room, Cassidy watches the battlefield and sighs.]

Cassidy: I can’t stand it anymore, I have to leave tonight.

[At night, Cassidy sneaks out of the palace in a peasants clothes. She passes through the border and sneaks into a nearby cottage.]

[Inside, Maurice is ready for bed when he hears a loud thump.]

Maurice: Who’s that? I need to check out.

[He looks around. A hooded silhouette just landed through the window, it takes the hood off to reveal a purple mottled cat with a princess tiara.]

Maurice: Princess Cassidy?! How-How are you here?

Cassidy: Hiding from my father, idiot! Wait-you’re a dog! Oh dear, what have I gotten myself into?!

[Maurice watches in surprise as Cassidy throws her tiara away.]

Maurice: What are you doing? Aren’t you a royal?

Cassidy: Enough weird questions, I’m staying at your house.

Maurice: …WHAT-

==Ep.3 Childhood Buddies==
Maurice: Cassidy, I know you’re a princess and you might hate it, but we only have berries and mushrooms here.

Cassidy: MUSHROOMS?! Oh dear heavens, I thought you at least have something else!

Maurice: Yeah, but we’re too poor to buy other types of food.

Cassidy: I’ll tell Father when I go back, about how awful life is here!

Maurice: Didn’t you say you’re avoiding him and that’s why you’re here?

Cassidy: Yeah…the war has really separated the both of us, have we?

Maurice: ?

Cassidy: I remember we used to play together when we’re children! I have proof! (walks towards the photos on the walls and points at a purple kitten right next to childhood Maurice) See?

Maurice: WE USED TO BE PLAYMATES?!

Cassidy: Yeah! But Father hated you dogs, and waged a war 10 years ago, when I was 8 and Mother was sick. I’ve never seen you since…until now!

[Trumpet noises outside]

Maurice: Must be the mayor, there must be news.

[Maurice puts a dog beret on Cassidy’s head and pulled her to the town square.]

Mayor Crescent: Hello everyone! It is with great sadness that most of our townsmen are forced to join and have died during the recent war with Horse County. And Princess Cassidy of Catanoia is currently missing, after Sir Tauri is severely injured and she is assigned a new mate for the upcoming wedding next week with Oleander, son of the Mountain Cats. This marriage will supposedly unite the Mountain Tribe and Catanoia, if you see Princess Cassidy, please report to us immediately.

[At the market]

Maurice: Everyone’s looking for you, you sure you’re still staying?

Cassidy: Of course! I don’t want my life to be planned out like my sister Sophie, I just want to be a normal citizen! I don’t want to marry Oleander, I don’t want to get married yet!

Maurice: Hmm…we’ll figure that out soon.

Cassidy: I’ll go back to the cottage and think.

[Maurice watches as Cassidy leaves, he suddenly notices two silvery figures walking around in the crowd. Assuming them as guards, he runs towards Cassidy.]

Maurice: Cassidy! The guards!

[The two figures spot them and chases after them, they ran back to the cottage and the two figures pounded on the door. Cassidy hid in Maurice’s bedroom while Maurice peeked out the door.]

Charmaine: Sir, have you seen Princess Cassidy?

Opal: We’re only here to look for her and protect her from any danger, we don’t mean any harm.

==Ep.4 The Truth of the King==
Maurice: What are you doing?

Opal: We’re on your side, sir.

Maurice: Our side?

Opal: We’re umm…suspicious of the king!

Charmaine: Opal! We can’t tell that much to a peasant!

Opal: He’s planning to attack our hometown! He’s gonna kill us Persian Cats! Don’t believe him! We need help!

Charmaine: OPAL! THAT’S NOT WHAT WERE SUPPOSED TO DO!

Opal: Sorry, Charmaine. It’s just I can’t see my friends in my town getting burnt alive.

Maurice: Maybe we can help you, but I’m not sure if I should trust you guys.

Charmaine: We can keep an eye on him, and you can still take care of Cass. We won’t take her away, we’re only worried.

Maurice: …Ok? Cassidy can help too, right?

Charmaine &amp; Opal: (nods)

Maurice: Cassidy!

[Cassidy peeps out the cottage door]

Cassidy: What’s up?

Maurice: Can you keep secrets?

Cassidy: Yeah, why? Oh, Opal, Charmaine! Why are you-

Opal: They’re proclaiming war at Persian Town!

Cassidy: Persian Town’s supposed to be revolting and attacking us, isn’t it?

Charmaine: No, Cass. You must listen, your father’s proclaiming war on US.

Cassidy: That’s impossible!

Maurice: You can still keep an eye, right?

Cassidy: I don’t know who to trust, but I’ll try to spy on him as much as I can.

Maurice: It’s getting late, you guys should go.

Charmaine: It’s safe with us, sir!

[Cassidy takes a stroll in the woods when she hears King Dusk talking to some spiders]

King Dusk: Ready?

Ingrum: Yes, your majesty.

Charlotte: So we’re attacking in three days?

Cobb: No, in a week!

Hairy: Three days, Cobb! We’re gonna sneak attack the Persians with our webs!

Cassidy: (whispers) I need to tell Maurice! We need to stop Father!

== Ep.5 Fireworks &amp; Sparks ==
Cassidy: Maurice! Father’s planning to bombard Persian Town with spiderwebs in three days!

Maurice: Ok then! To the border!

Cassidy: But we can’t go-

Maurice: You came here through the border right?

Cassidy: Yeah…

[At the border, the couple meets up with the Royal Guard duo]

Opal: Any news?

Cassidy: Father’s planning a sneak attack with spiderwebs on your town in three days-no-TWO DAYS!

Charmaine: I knew that king is up to no good!

Cassidy: And he’s making deals with SPIDERS!

Charmaine: The Spider Gang? And their leader should be…Ingrum, right? Opal?

Opal: Yes, Ingrum’s team sells extremely sticky spiderwebs. We’re doomed!

Charmaine: There is a tunnel for us to get to your township, but it’s narrow and it’ll take days to get everyone from Persian Town to here!

Opal: We’ll think of something, Charmaine. Don’t fret.

Maurice: What about us?

Cassidy: Still spying on the king?

Opal &amp; Charmaine: Yes! We’ll meet up here tomorrow!

[Back at the town, Maurice gives a detailed tour for Cassidy, but she seems upset.]

Maurice: What’s wrong?

Cassidy: It’s just…I hate Father, but I can’t believe he would do such a thing!

Maurice: I can cheer you up! There’s a fireworks festival tonight!

Cassidy: What?

Maurice: The Annual Barksville Fireworks Festival! You’ve never heard of that?

Cassidy: No, we’ve never have one in Catanoia, Father has banned all use of them.

Maurice: Oh, no wonder you hate him! He’s ruining all the fun!

Cassidy: (giggles)

[At night, Cassidy and Maurice watch the fireworks festival. The night sky is filled with all sorts of colours.]

Cassidy: Maurice, this is the best firework show EVER!

Maurice: Told you it’s awesome!

[At the forest background, a young spider, Charlotte notices the couple. She heads towards a crowd of other spiders. On the highest tree branch was Ingrum, who gracefully falls on a web in the middle.]

Charlotte: Ma’am, our plan’s complete.

Ingrum: I’ll tell King Dusk, she’ll get what she deserves.

Charlotte: She?

Ingrum: Yes, it’s a she.

[The spiders leaves with the bristling of the leaves.]

Cassidy: Who’s that?

Maurice: What?

Cassidy: Nothing!

Maurice: You must be thinking too much, let’s go home after the show ends.

== Ep.6 Well, That’s Gonna be a Problem ==
Maurice: Morning, Cassidy!

Cassidy: You can just call me Cass, that’s what  everyone in the Palace calls me.

Maurice: Ok, should we go meet the Royal Guards?

Cassidy: Let’s go!

[They run to the border, where Charmaine and Opal are…hiding?]

Maurice: What are you-

Opal: (whisper) Hush! They blocked the tunnels!

Charmaine: Both your kingdom and our town are guarded now!

Cassidy: I remember what they said last night!

Everyone: Who?

Cassidy: Father wants to get revenge on someone, but who? It might be me: for leaving the kingdom, or someone else!

Maurice: Whoever it is, I don’t think it’s gonna end well.

Opal: The attack’s in a day and we still haven’t evacuated everyone!

Charmaine: I guess we have to…(sighs) go with the flow.

Cassidy: No! We can’t let my kingdom destroy you for no reason!

Maurice: I can get help, the dogs are really helpful here.

Charmaine: But they won’t believe us, we’re cats!

[Suddenly, King Dusk, the Spider Gang and many soldiers appear out of nowhere.]

King Dusk: What is going on here?

Cassidy: Father, stop all this nonsense!

King Dusk: Charmaine, Opal, you have put your families and friends in front of your duties!  Take them away!

[Charmaine and Opal squeal in horror as they’re tangled up in webs.]

Cassidy: Father! You can’t do this! They don’t deserve it.

King Dusk: Princesses don’t feel pity for traitors.

Cassidy: Father, please reconsider! They don’t mean it!

[King Dusk and his soldiers leave with Charmaine and Opal.]

Ingrum: Princess Cassidy, King Dusk wants you to come home.

Cassidy: (angry) I WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE! I HATE YOU, FATHER!

Charlotte: Uh-

Cobb: You-

Cassidy: A princess shall escort herself!

[Cassidy pulls Maurice by the hand and they dart back to the township. The townsfolk look angry as they arrived the town square.]

Tala: Maurice! What have you done?! Keeping the Royal Princess?! Helping Persian Town?!

Maurice: I-I can explain!

Spirit: Explain?! Why can’t the “princess” explain herself?

Cassidy: You won’t believe it, but Father’s evil! He’s gonna bombard Persian Town with SPIDERWEBS without any reason!

Hugo: Whatever! Maurice, get out of your stupid fantasies and take her back to where she belongs!

Maurice: You’re not listening to the truth, guys! Ugh! I gotta go! Cassidy?

Cassidy: How ignorant! Maurice, I need to find Father to negotiate, or convince him.

Maurice: Sure, but be safe!

[Maurice leaves the town square and return to the cottage while Cassidy crosses the border and barges in the Royal Palace again.]

Cassidy: Father!

King Dusk: I can’t believe you’re doing this! You’re wrecking the kingdom!

Cassidy: I’m only here to-

King Dusk: You’re going back to your bedroom, NOW!

Cassidy: But, Father, I-

King Dusk: Get back in your bedroom, I will check on you from time to time. Don’t you dare try to leave, future Queen.

[Back in the cottage, Maurice is still worried, so he also crossed the border and finds Cassidy, who’s up on her bedroom balcony.]

Maurice: CASS!

Cassidy: MAURICE!

[They hugged in joy.]

Cassidy: What are we going to do? Father wouldn’t listen!

Maurice: We’ll free them, I promise!

Cassidy: What about the townsfolk-

Maurice: I know just the way to do so.

Cassidy: What?

Maurice: Hold my hand.

[Cassidy does what she’s told.]

Maurice: Jump.

== Ep.7 The Mice’s Assistance ==
[The couple jumps and lands on a pile of leaves.]

Maurice: Now we need to free your Royal Guard friends! King Dusk locked them up in the dungeon, right?

Cassidy: (nods, then shakes head) Yes, then he moved them.

Maurice: How?

Cassidy: That’s what the maids said while I was going back to my bedroom.

Maurice: Where is it?

Cassidy: (mysteriously) The Abandoned Dungeon.

Maurice: What are we waiting for, let’s go!

[They arrive at the deep parts of the forest.]

Cassidy: There’s one problem, I have no idea where it is.

Maurice: Why couldn’t you tell me earlier, now what?

???: Follow us!

Cassidy: What are you?

???: We heard your plea, your majesty. The Maids can’t come, so we’re sent instead.

[Three small mice popped out from the bushes.]

Nina: Follow us.

Squeakers: We’ll take you there.

[The couple followed the mice to the Abandoned Dungeon. King Dusk, Ingrum, Charmaine, and Opal are there.]

Charmaine: You can’t do this to us!

King Dusk: Don’t get carried away. My daughter will find you, but I’m gonna relocate you soon.

Opal: You won’t get through us without a sword fight!

Ingrum: Oh, we’ll see about that.

Opal: I will not let you take us, you monster!

King Dusk: Why? Because your town is getting what they deserve!

Charmaine: What did we do to you to deserve this?

Ingrum: Oh, it’s not you, it’s your mother.

Charmaine: Mother? But she’s dead long ago! What did she do to deserve this?

[Ingrum is ready to shoot a web at Charmaine.]

Opal: Don’t you dare!

[Opal was shot instead.]

Ingrum: Oh, that’s a deep friendship!

Charmaine: That’s a knight’s duty, to protect their loved ones!

Ingrum: (stammer) Loved…ones?

Opal: So what?

Ingrum: Whatever! See you tomorrow! Ha!

King Dusk: You won’t be here forever! You’ll be bait for the war!

Charmaine &amp; Opal: WHAT-

[Meanwhile.]

Cassidy: You sure we’re following the right path? It’s been an hour already!

Maurice: I’m hungry!

Nina: I promise you it’s the right path, your majesty.

[Back at the Abandoned Dungeon.]

Charmaine: We’re going to be BAIT FOR THE WAR?! Aren’t you getting serious, Opal?

Opal: Yeah, I guess we’re dead anyways, stuck in a stupid cell.

Charmaine: At least we still have each other-LOOK! IT’S THE MICE!

Nina: Charie!

Mac: Opal!

Squeakers: We brought you buddies!

Maurice: Enough blabbering! Find the lock!

Cassidy: Can you climb up the gates?

Nina: There’s a lock at the top!

Mac: We’re too small!

Squeakers: Oh, I know! Can you stack up together?

[Cassidy and Maurice stacked up together with the mice.]

[Nina unlocks the lock with a hairpin, the three mice open the door together and Charmaine and Opal leaves. With the mice’s help, Opal gets all the sticky webs out of her.]

Opal: No time to lose. Let’s go home!

Cassidy: And stop that war! I’d better confront my father again.

Mac: Again? Seriously, how many times?

Cassidy: The last one, I promise.

== Ep.8 Arranged Marriages ==
[Cassidy and the mice runs off to the castle.]

King Dusk: Princess Cassidy, where have you been? You went looking for them, did you?

Nina: No, your majesty. We’re in the bedroom the whole time.

King Dusk: That’s what I thought.

Cassidy: Why are you so cruel?

King Dusk: I’m only doing for what’s best for us, dear.

Cassidy: Liar! Persian Town’s innocent, you’re the one who started all this! You’re lying, why?

King Dusk: How dare you speak against the King? You’re the liar!

Cassidy: No! You’re lying! I’ve never believed in you after all of this! You’re nothing but a terrible cat!

King Dusk: (mumble) You’re just like your mother.

Cassidy: Mother?

King Dusk: I mean, you’re going on a date tonight with Oleander.

Cassidy: No, Father! I don’t like him! I said that already that I only treat him as a friend!

King Dusk: Don’t worry, you’ll know more about him. I’m sure you’ll love him soon before your wedding and coronation.

Cassidy: But-

King Dusk: NO BUTS! YOU WILL HAVE A DATE WITH HIM TONIGHT!

[Evening, at a fancy restaurant. Cassidy’s in a gorgeous evening gown while Oleander’s in a fancy tuxedo suit.]

Oleander: Uh…I-My stunning princess, I’m so honoured t-to have a date with you and be your future husband. I-I’ve got a nice seat for you, just look at the beautiful scenery of the lake!

[Cassidy is completely uninterested, however.]

Oleander: Shall we eat, umm…my lady?

Cassidy: …Yeah, whatever.

[Meanwhile, Charmaine, Opal and a bunch of confused husky townsfolks from Barksville are looking from someone.]

Prince: You sure the newspaper publishers from both of our kingdoms is coming?

Charmaine: Yes.

Slush: They’re here!

Hunk: Meadow! Slick!

Charmaine: You know most about our kingdoms, do you have anything special about the war?

Meadow &amp; Slick: It’s top secret, we-

Opal: That’s against the rule: Always tell the truth to a knight.

Meadow &amp; Slick: Fine! King Dusk is going to demolish Persian Town, after he get revenge on someone he used to love dearly!

Meadow: We even interviewed the spiders, but they chased us away!

Slick: Then he’s going to kill all the dogs and take over their land!

Opal &amp; Charmaine: Oh no!

The Huskies: We have to tell the others, NOW!

Meadow &amp; Slick: We’ll make the newest papers on it ASAP!

[Back at the restaurant.]

Oleander: You’re not looking at me, p-princess. Why? Are you sad?

Cassidy: (upset) Hmph!

Oleander: Uh-Because you’re forced to join this date?

Cassidy: Olly, what do you mean “forced to”?

Oleander: You don’t love me, right?

Cassidy: (sternly) Yes.

Oleander: Same.

Cassidy: How?

Oleander: We’re just…not meant for each other. I’m in love with a local forest girl, but before I can confess it to her, there’s a war between the Mountain Tribe and Catanoia. I’m forced to marry you to make peace, but I want to be with her, not you-I’m sorry, did I…say too much? Does it hurt?

Cassidy: No, it feels better if you tell the truth, anyway.

Oleander: Who do you like then?

Cassidy: I’m in love with a peasant dog, though I’m sure it’s against the rules…but I see we both have similarities. Let’s leave, and tell those ones how much we loved them.

Oleander: Yes, my p-princess!

Cassidy: You can just call me Cass, like before.

Oleander: Yes, Cass!

[Cassidy and Oleander leave the restaurant, Oleander heads off to the Mountains while Cassidy goes to the cottage, where Maurice is picking berries.]

Cassidy: Maurice! You wouldn’t believe what happened back there. Father forced me to have a date with Oleander!

Maurice: How did it turn out? Horrible?

Cassidy: No! He confessed that he doesn’t want to marry me at all, he likes someone else, just like me!

Maurice: You like someone else?! Who is it?

[Cassidy kisses Maurice on the cheek.]

Cassidy: You.

Maurice: (blushes) That-

[Megaphone trumpet noises]

Maurice: It’s the mayor again! What is it this time?

Cassidy: I guess we have to go to the town square again, huh?

== Ep.9 All is Revealed ==
Meadow: BIG NEWS! BIG NEWS! KING DUSK’S EVIL PLANS ARE REVEALED TODAY!

Slick: GET YOUR LATEST NEWS ON THE WAR OF PERSIAN TOWN TODAY!

Tala: WHAT?! King Dusk’s evil?! That-

Spirit: Of course you think it’s fake, you’re only a baby when the war ended!

The Huskies: Guys, what Slick and Meadow are saying are real, we questioned them with Charmaine and Opal!

Mayor Crescent: Attention everyone! We are going to assist the Persians in today’s war, and lead a rebellion against the king! I repeat, we are going to assist the Persians in today’s war and lead a rebellion against the king!

Hugo: EVERYONE GET TO PERSIAN TOWN RIGHT NOW!!! WE ARE READY TO FIGHT!

== Ep.10 The Rebellion Awaits ==
[Background with webs and everyone screaming.]

Mayor Asher: Please! We did nothing wrong!

Mayor Crescent: Stop attacking both of our towns!

Cassidy: They’ve done nothing to you, you can’t hurt them like this!

King Dusk: I don’t care what you think, you little brat!

Maurice: Stop talking to my girlfriend like that!

King Dusk: You-Cats and Dogs can’t date, that’s against the law!

Cassidy: Really? We don’t care, you’ve destroyed the honour of our kingdom for your selfishness!

King Dusk: Like do you think I care? You’re the ones who’s destroying our kingdom, Princess Cassidy! You’re the worst daughter in existence! Why can’t you learn from Sophie?

Mayor Crescent: Daughter?

Cassidy: What do you mean?

Mayor Crescent: Cassandra, is that you?

Cassidy: Only Mother calls me that, and she’s a leopard, there’s no way you’re my mother!

King Dusk: CAN’T YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH?!

Mayor Crescent: She needs to know the truth!

[Ingrum, sitting on King Dusk’s shoulder shoots a web at Mayor Crescent and Mayor Asher. Mayor Crescent’s hood falls off in the process, revealing her actual cat ears.]

King Dusk: I’m gonna make you suffer from what you made me do.

[All the cat soldier start attacking the place, the Rebellion team tries to stop them but fails.]

Charmaine: (gets stuck in webs) Ah!

Opal: Charie!

Mayor Crescent: Charmaine! Cassandra! You can’t hurt my daughters, you puny spiders!

Charmaine: Mom?!

Cassidy: Wait-if she says that Charmaine and I are her daughters, we’re siblings! Father, I need to know the truth, NOW!!

The Huskies: Mayor Crescent, tell her the truth!

King Dusk: I won’t let you stop me! (points a knife at Charmaine) Stop right now, or I’ll kill her!

Mayor Crescent: No! Charmaine!

King Dusk: Time’s ticking, my queen.

Mayor Crescent: I’ll give in, just let go of her!

[Opal, Maurice and Cassidy run towards Mayor Crescent.]

Maurice: We can’t let both of us surrender like this!

Cassidy: What should we do?

Opal: Ah! I’m so confused!

Mayor Asher: Confront him, and tell everyone the truth.

Opal: Everyone’s fighting and the dogs are breaking everything! What should we do?!

Mayor Crescent: Frights! Even after everything you did to me, I still loved you! Please, just leave us alone!

King Dusk: You have no idea what you’ve put me through, you traitor!

Mayor Crescent: Frights, please!

King Dusk: I’m done trusting you, Crescent, I was done years ago.

Maurice: (with megaphone) MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?!

Everyone: ?!

Cassidy: Father says the Persians and the Dogs, BUT THEY’RE NOT! I’VE SPENT TIME WITH THEM AND THEY’RE THE NICEST BEINGS ON PLANET EARTH!!

Maurice: (whispers) You don’t have to yell, you know. (through megaphone) And we also learnt that (points at King Dusk) YOU are the one who started the war!

All Persian Cats: And why would WE believe you?

Opal: Guys, we have proof!

Slick &amp; Meadow: You’ve read the newspapers, he’s gonna destroy the dogs and Persian Cats to have the land all to himself!

All Dogs: They’re telling the truth!

Cat Soldiers: Ok-WHAT?!

King Dusk: No! They’re lying! You fox morons!

Mayor Crescent: Frights! You’ve not just taken my throne while I was sick, you’ve even-(coughs) I, as Queen Crescent, the TRUE ruler of Catanoia, shall banish you from this place forever, you must not come back or we’ll tear you to bits!

All Cats: (with pitchforks) Traitor! Traitor!

Persian Cats &amp; Dogs: You don’t even deserve to be our leader! Boo!

[A giant swarm of cats push King Dusk off a slope, sending him rolling, down and down.]

Cassidy: So long, Father!

Sophie: DAD!!!

Cassidy: Sophie, you’re so late! Did you listen to all that? He doesn’t even deserve to be our father!

Sophie: (sobs)

Queen Crescent: Cassandra! Sophia!

Sophie: Mommy!

Cassidy: Mother!

[Queen Crescent hugs the two of them, the looks at Charmaine, who doesn’t look like she’s fond of it.]

Queen Crescent: You can hug me, dear. You know.

Charmaine: Fine…mom. I just thought you were dead all those years ago.

Queen Crescent: I’ll tell you the whole story: your father and I met each other during a royal party and it was like love at first sight, we were soon married but over time, I had to focus on my royal duties as queen and he grew cold and thought I didn’t love him. When I was sick after giving birth to you three, he took care of two of you for me and left the last one for the royal guards. He then banished me to the dogs village, where I was healed and elected as mayor. To this day, I still blame myself for letting him do whatever he wants while I was sick and weak…I would never let him take my kingdom and you ever again.

Cassidy: Don’t cry, Mother. We’re always here together.

Sophie: And I shouldn’t have let Dad control me and start the war.

Charmaine: So what now? The king’s gone and Mother’s still recovering, right?

Cassidy: We can build a new kingdom, with both of the cats and dogs!

Queen Crescent: Yes! And we shall be united once more!

Maurice: Uh…your majesty?

Queen Crescent: What’s the matter?

Maurice: It might be against our rules but Cassidy and I-

Queen Crescent: The kingdom’s now united, and the rules…really need to change. Yes, you can date her. I won’t let the rules define who you are and who you love.

Maurice: Yay! Now what?

Cassidy: Look for new places to explore?

Sophie, Charmaine &amp; Opal: Yes! (runs off, laughing in joy)

Cassidy: Maurice! You coming?

Maurice: In a minute!

[Maurice picks up a small photo of him and Dougie from his pocket.]

Maurice: I hope you’re happy there, we’ve gone through a revolution and we’ve got a brand new kingdom. You’re the best brother I’ve ever had.

[Maurice follows the rest of the characters as a rainbow shines above the sky.]

Narrator: Five months have passed since the events here and things are pretty much in peace. The spiders and insects have joined the kingdom and Ingrum’s team is forgiven for their involvement in King Dusk’s plans. Oleander and his girlfriend he once mentioned are getting married soon and…oh dear, what about Maurice and Cassidy?

Maurice: Cass? Can I show you something?

Cassidy: Ok.

[Maurice takes Cassidy to the balcony where they watched fireworks.]

Cassidy: What are you doing?

Maurice: Will you marry me?</text>

== Character List ==

* Siley (pronounced “Silly”), Unidentified shapeshifting beast, main character
* Kira - Lion, teacher of Jamaa Merit High School
* Jax - Arctic wolf, popular kid #1
* Ace - Fox, popular kid #2
* Alice - Tiger, nerd

== 1 - Who I am Makes me Proud ==
A cat with purple and green fur, pink mystic eyes, wearing antlers, a heavy coat, bowtie, furry arm cuffs, and an unusually fluffy purple tail. This is the first description you think of when you first see me. It’s not very much what’s in style right now, but rather an older look seemingly from AMD (After Mira’s Disappearing) 152. It’s AMD 203, and the 34th year of Jamaa Township’s existence being so big.

I listen to the favorite music of Jammers right now, I want to wear Leo Clockwork’s newest items, and I go to the pillow room after school each week to hang out with people. You’d expect me to be a Jammer though, even with the older look, right?

That point is the only wrong thing you’d expect of me. I wasn’t really a jammer or a phantom, rather a shapeshifting beast in between known as a Phantanimal. You listen to differing myths from heroes from AMD 82 and before, describing us as creatures with tentacles along our spines and bones adorning our tails, or the famous story which posed the idea of phantanimals as someone who could end up either so powerful that they were like gods, or generic like most expect a phantom to look.

My name is Siley, I suppose they were trying to write “Silly” due to my looks, which in my purest state looks like if an arctic wolf was severely caught in a fire. My teacher, Kira, doesn’t seem to mind. Apparently, she’s had students with worse names that got tested and came out as a jammer. 

Speaking of that, I’m a part of a secret mission to discover a plan that The Alphas have to try and defeat us. In the meanwhile, I’m also studying the world so we can copy it to start our own dimension that is an exact replica, down to the soil contents of each individual inch of land. 

To do this, I go to a school, in specific, it’s Jamaa Merit High School. It’s supposedly a top class school, and most of the time, only non-gifted individuals are allowed in unless they can prove their powers have nothing to do with knowledge. I make my eyes look mystic and deep pink with contacts, and I disguise as a cat with purple and green fur to try and hide most of my features. I also have some fixed markings that I can change the shape of, but not the color of. I make it look more like a design choice by changing the pattern to lightning. I’ll also wear outfits that came from the Frozen Era (AMD 110-160). I do this to cover the mark on my neck’s side. People just assume I like Jamaa’s history, and I play along with that.

Anyways, here’s the story of how I did the unthinkable, and passed the Jammer-Phantom test as a phantom aligned beast.

== 2 - I Accidentally Passed a Test by Looking Away ==
On July 30th of AMD 202, the phantoms gave me all the answers to the Jamaa Merit High School entry quiz. This would be a key piece to gaining information, as Jamaa Merit has many people come in from Jamaa military roles to visit, sometimes talking about plans the Alphas have. Some plan discussions are more ramble-filled than others, but still full of information.

Upon sitting down to take the test, I noticed that one of the teachers seemed vulnerable enough to be killed. Most of the questions referred to the “History” of Jamaa, a incorrect telling of a war story, plagued with the things they think you know as a fact. They think the phantoms will tell you an incorrect story, when it is the Alphas who give you just that.

Answering the questions, I expected to get at least one wrong. I looked at the board and posters to check to see if there are any answers uncovered. I didn’t find any answers, but I did see a small note that I could read on the teachers desk. It read “Reminder: Test the blood of everyone after the other tests. Purple blood is not allowed!”

I thought about it for a moment. I didn’t know a blood test would also be taken after the quiz, I put a jammer blood patch of a cat on where they draw the blood from jammers as required by law, one on each wrist. It matches perfectly with my fur due to the technology. I felt my temperature drop for the rest of the test, leading up to the blood test.

Fighting tests came up, of which I learned the basic moves needed for the quiz. I got an 87 out of 95 due to some faults in my movements.

Then came the blood test.

As they took blood, they reached deep enough in to hit the patch just right, taking the cat blood and not mine. My temperature raised back to normal when I saw the blood was that from the patch. The teachers discussed some things, like how I was quiet most of the time other than answering questions and some things while fighting, but didn’t get suspicious.

Two days later, after checking the mail, I had noticed one thing. I had passed the test that supposedly no phantom could get through.

Pain hurt. Pain hurt like a thousand needles were stuck to your skin, and you were dragged along a highway like a badly strung sleeping bag on a camping trip. (Antares never knew what happened to that bag.)

The games were stupid, and Antares hated the fact that this guy was meant to be the opponent that would kill him. Some a**hole who kept making him confused with his teleportation, attacking him from everywhere he least expected. He knew he'd probably be pulled onto the field more often, considering he'd already ruined his relationship, but he didn't expect to lie there for a fraction of a moment with steam exiting him like a broken car, as he tried to return air to his lungs. He didn't know what this meant about his anatomy, as he'd expect himself to breathe less in this state, not more, as the smoke left him and wind entered his system. 

He looked at the sky. He'd become a bit more athletic- He was always a pretty strong, fast guy, just never smart enough to think in the moment. His instincts would take over. Training with Solaris helped him clear his mind.

Solaris' fighting style was clean, orderly, yet fast. It used as much as needed, and yet the first few times Antares sparred with him, he did feel overwhelmed. Solaris was ''really'' good, and he couldn't imagine him in the arena, in a scenario where he actively had to kill. Did he even have to kill? Apollo was still alive. Maybe he just had to injure someone enough to seem dead. Solaris would be good at that.

Antares got back up after that momentary pause, with a burst of flame that let him get back on his feet. He looked at the other guy, knowing he'd forget his dark, braided hair, dark skin, and the look in his green eyes when he saw Antares attack.

Training with Solaris taught him a lot. Solaris was kind enough to unintentionally inform him a bit on how to beat people like this. 

''"You truly do just want to end the enemy at once. But the best way to fight an enemy is by holding back a little, letting them think they have a window of opportunity, setting their guards down."''

Well, that certainly worked for Solaris, who knew how Antares fought. But it wouldn't work for the man standing in front of him. So he let a nice trick he taught himself fly. 

Antares couldn't help but think what Solaris would be thinking about this trick. He wished he could think about something else, but when the first part of his attack started, his mind inevitably turned towards that instead. The floor of the arena was covered in a small layer of fire, which the other boy had to constantly teleport above just so it wouldn't singe his shoes. 

Antares had wanted to try it on Solaris, but Solaris told him that doing this would be extremely dangerous, and terribly hard to control. Antares decided not to control the flames at all, loosening his MagiMin further with his left hand so they'd go crazy. But his brain wasn't mad. He felt like thinking of Solaris had made it cool a bit. He didn't like it, and that made it heat up again. Like a broken thermometer. 

People in the arena would only see the flames dance, grow, and change colors a bit from an aggressive red to a bright yellow. The attacker seemed to be confusing themselves, as Antares let himself be consumed by the fire. They couldn't touch him anymore.

Then, in a burst, they went straight to the top of the protective dome, with barely any room for the other person to breathe, sending them into a coughing fit. Antares let the flames die to watch them fall, and with a hard ''thunk,'' pass out. Liza seemed to assume he was dead, and that familiar noise rang in his ears. 

Antares collapsed onto the field. He couldn't do this for much, and he was exhausted. The arena's onlookers started to file out.

"You have been there for a while. Are you alright?" A familiar voice asked. Antares looked up to see Solaris. 

"I don't know, man. I'm too tired to tell," he chuckled. Solaris let out a small laugh. 

"Are you too tired for me to pull you up?" He rolled his eyes.

"Nah."

Solaris grabbed his left hand, and pulled him up. "Why are you being so nice to me?" Antares asked.

"You've been through a rough patch. I don't want our scholarly relationship to crumble because we can't respect each other. I find it quite just," Solaris looked at Antares in the eyes. Antares looked back.

"Yeah. Wanna practice?"

"If you need to."

"Need to? Nah. Wanna show you what more I've got? Totally."

"I believe that's an excuse to spend time with me, Mercier." Solaris smirked.

"Go eat a rubber band, or something. What do you eat? I've never seen you eat."

"Food. Have ''you'' ever eaten a rubber band?"

"...No comment." Antares grumbled.

"jake you know you dont wanna see my warewolf form. put the pen down." after hearing this jake immediately put down the pen and pushed the za into jat's chest "emily please get out of the mens room" and but jake ran out the room crying and emily snapped out of her werewolf mode. "j-j-jake!!" she shouted, running dramatically with her hand out as jake gets ready to hit up jat's mother instead of jat himself because no way emily would catch him. then boom! while he was going on a romantic date hittin up the pub gettin a pint with jay's mother emily did a drive by and had to make sure everyone in the establishment got popped. she did a check and saw jake with jat's mother. "oh youre with him now." emily said

"no emily its not what it looks like-" "frogot it jake. you dont care." she started going to hot topic every weekend with her allowance from that point on and started listening to crap music like alex g and any lemon demon song other than modify and fine. and she wasnt even british she was bulgarian. bulmerican.

moral of the story: if youre a european just say youre from bulgaria or whatever or people will think youre british which is an awful fate because as a german scot i hate brits. also make sure to not date anyone named jat or jake because they will literally literally. and get a pint with their mother to pattern her up thank you for watching like and subscribe

both jat and jake went threw the 6 stages of greef after this incident with emily. they were traumatized and the worst part they cant even watch MURDER DORNES!!! because of the emily girl sends them back and they have a panic attack

so not being able to watch quality content made by people who hit their employees the two started resorting to heavy mesures. jat and jake went on a sword fighting date were… lets just say… they went fencing with big white armor and jat won and everyone cheered

but after they started watching… g-grt this… they started resorting to watching chains for real and kai cenat gets zooted with livvy dunn and baby gronk off of fentanyl laced crack and tranq the fbi caught them doing these highly illegal substances so there was only one solution

they took their ohio skibidi why sigma males are more attractive than alpha males gyat ohio ice spice twerk rainbow gummy bear surprise carts and headed up to vancouver where drugs are legal!!!

but emily soon found out that jat and jake had left to country, because she entered in the code to his house and he wasnt there. she fell to her knees and started to cry “j-j-jat!!” now after the incident with jake she only cares about jat

she went threw multiple depressive and psychotic episodes before her family got worried and to make her feel better they got in touch with make a wish and she got her wish to travel the world. she ended up going to vancouver first.

while walking down the streets of the city she saw a familiar blue haired black long spiked headdress wearing arctic wolf twink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! she realized this. it was j-jake?! and he was.. HE WAS ON A DATE WITH JAT!

emilys eyes turned red. she started to fume with anger and the flames inside of her could never be extuingished. she said “the pain is too much i cant taje it” and she started to cry again.

jat felt so bad so he decided him and jakes forbidden love was not vaible. he left jake and ran after emily. he caught up with her and kissed her on the lips.

The two pulled apart, their saliva connecting, a trial of pure love. Emily batted her eyelashes. Jat got on his knees. “I love you, Emily. I always have.. Will you.. Marry me?” 

Jat stared up at her beautiful eyes, they were like galaxies far away. He blushed waiting in anticipation for her response.

cliffhanger wait 4 part 3!!!

==Chapter 1==
A fox trotted across Jamaa, wearing a spiked collar, yelling out loud ''“Shops my den!”''  before a weird otter, with a ripped ear, wearing an oddly grey zombie mask with red eyes, with a ragged cloak, and chains across its tail, would crawl across the ground, crawling across the crowd. The otter would grab a sandwich that an arctic wolf held with its paw, before xerting &lt;u&gt;(swallow, or gulp fast and greedily)&lt;/u&gt; the sandwich, and running away, The Arctic wolf would begin chasing it, shouting ''“Give me my sandwich back!”'' before the otter shouted conjubilantly &lt;u&gt;(Shouting with, or in joy)&lt;/u&gt; with joy ''“Gjoo!!''”. The Arctic wolf would stop, it’s mind processing what the word the otter shouted, before chasing the otter, until the Arctic wolf bumped into a purple tree, with green cracks across it and an evil smile with purple glowing out of it, the otter was behind the tree, before crawling up to the Arctic wolf, looking at it, and backflipping into the “mouth” of the tree as soon as the Arctic wolf tried to hit it with its paw, His paw would strike the ground as a pawful of dust would fly out of the air. 

The Arctic wolf, known as Combû, or simply C, was mad, hopping into the mouth, until he began to black out,  waking up in a purple grassland with the otter covered in blood, holding a knife with its mouth, before taking off its mask, revealing a horrifyingly bloody face, with no eyes, sharp teeth covered in blood, an evil smile smothered with blood, and holding a snickersnee &lt;u&gt;(Long, sword-like knife)&lt;/u&gt; along its tail, Blood would fall between Combû’s eyes, as he looked directly at the blood, before the otter grabbed the snickersnee, and stabbing the Arctic wolf, but Combû rolled before the otter landed a hit, a loud screech was heard from a pipe, coloured violet, with magenta, glowing tracks along it. The Arctic wolf was distracted, and began running towards the pipe as soon as the otter struck again with the snickersnee. 

''“TgooOOOOooo LghAAATee!”'' the otter would screech, before Combû would enter the pipe, and start running towards the light, before jumping, as he slowly shook his fur as he would close his eyes, before feeling a touch on his paws, like he was still in the ground, opening his eyes, before looking down, then up, only to look at a nearby pond, and see 67 otters, with different-coloured masks, The one in the middle was the largest, Combû would have a ring in his mind, instantly remembering a romp  (&lt;u&gt;Group of otters)&lt;/u&gt;  of 145 otters with a large leader known as Devourling, whom wore a brown, ragged cloak, a brown zombie mask with blue eyes, and had a torn ear, the rest had differently coloured, unique zombie masks to themselves, and the members wore tan cloaks, while the otter that Combû was chased by wore a dark tan cloak, and that the otter was one of the 15 foragers and gaurds of the romp.

He slowly backed away as he looked around, the entire romp of otters circling him, before Devourling would walk behind him, and it was only till Combû felt blood drip on his head between his ears, before he looked up, let out a gasp, and ran as Devourling chased him constantly before he jumped into the mouth of a tree.

Combû then woke up, as a paw constantly shook his head, ''“Hey, Combû! Wake up!”'' He heard, looking up at his friend, Polio, before jumping, ''“DONT KILL ME!”'' Combû shouted, ''“You’ve must had a nightmare indeed..”'' Polio reacted as he screamed, ''“Yea, I did.. It felt.. real.”'' Combû said, ''“Haha, we all have those sometimes,”'' Polio laughed.

Although we should be supporting his aid, we at the Starry Dawn Group are working towards other issues revolving not in our world, but one far from it, where a tragedy is said to occur in 8 days.

In a bit of a short notice, we made this guide to help others understand phantoms. A few, the most elusive or dangerous, have been left out of this guide due to the little information we have gotten about them.

== Basic Types and Subtypes ==
Common Phantom - Your usual 8 legged, floating beast. Usually paintseeds can be thrown at them to do harm, although it may also harm jammers if too close to said target. Also gets trapped in basic chomper plants.

Heavy Phantom - Subtype of the common phantom, they are known for having various nubs in a line going around the face, whilst also being larger, and thus heavier than the common phantom. Paintseeds have been proven to work decent, although in recent years, heavy phantoms require more than one to be defeated if sent to Jamaa.

Spitter/Mage phantoms - Another subtype of the common phantom, they are well characterized by hiding in plants and spitting burrs at jammers. They are the weakest of the basic types, and can be defeated by a regular boomseed. As they don’t move, chomper plants don’t notice them, and thus don’t consume them. Mages are a more magical variant of the spitter, using beams of miasma rather than burrs to attack, although same methods of defeat apply to them.

== Uncommon types and variants ==
Phantanimals - A general hybrid between jammers and phantoms, that can pass as a jammer with enough clothing. Usually, they have extra limbs, or tentacles sprouting from them. Paintseeds do harm them, but with the resistance of a jammer, they only go with minor injuries. They are one the two phantoms a sword would work on, and the only one that doesn’t need anything else to be fought with one. Cures for the condition are unknown.

Guise Phantoms - A full phantom disguising as an animal. Usually, they can be seen having unnatural colored double tails (variants unable to be found in stores) or having hidden limbs. Their eyes are often white, although rarely they can be yellow or purple. They can be defeated by paintseeds. This is the only other phantom you can fight with a sword, although you’d also need paintseeds when the disguise wears off. A mecha chomper will eat them out of disguise.

Twilight Storms - A phantom distinct from the common phantom, carrying lunar powers and manipulation of electricity. Although more recently seen by the public, they are not as easily defeated. Only by stealing the star shaped gems they hold can you remove their powers, and be able to defeat them. After that, it would take a mecha chomper or more paintseeds than a non-mutated phantom, but less than a fully mutated war phantom.

== Obscure Variants ==
Golden Mavericks - You may have seen the golden phantoms in games, and they are in fact real. Usually kept by kings as hostages or demanded as petlike beasts, these phantoms rarely see war. They are also the third weakest phantom, being able to be defeated by only one paintseed, compared to the 3 it takes to defeat a modern common phantom without mutations.

Rainbow Galaxites: A recently new variant, they are prized for their rainbow flecked sludge. However, they do not live easily, and tend to die on their own. They are also pet exclusive, and killing one would be a felony.

Serenity Fires: A general firefly-like phantom, with extra limbs carrying luminescent energy. They use this to communicate, or lure in jammers. If you cut off the light, it can be used as a weapon against them, or can be defeated with paintseeds.

==About==
''”Defenders of Jamaa: The Remake” is a story based on the original 2020 pet story “Defenders of Jamaa” by Loafie.''

''While the plot has been updated and many details changed, the remake remains a tale about a lizard named Audrey whose owner gets kidnapped by phantoms, leading her to seek out the help of a group of phantom-fighting lizards to set her owner free — and along the way, searching for the identity of a rumored spy in the group and uncovering the secrets of lizard magic.''

==Prologue - Liza’s POV==
Six pairs of pawsteps flattened the waving fields in the outskirts of Sarepia Forest. Nothing but the limited safety of nighttime hid their figures against the distant trees and hanging bridges that decorated the town up ahead. Nowhere in Jamaa was safe anymore, nowhere – not even at the earliest hour of the morning, not even for animals entrusted with otherworldly power to protect the land.

The six alphas rarely traveled without the aid of tiger troopers, courageous volunteers from an army raised by Sir Gilbert the tiger alpha, but a mysterious conversation had drawn Liza out of a deep sleep and into the open land to investigate alongside her five closest allies.

Peck had heard the jumbly, high-pitched chatter moments before Liza did; though it was expected that phantoms regularly sept into Jamaa and spied on whatever resistance efforts possible when the sun was far from peeking out over the lands, they rarely ever took such a risk as to talk to one another where jammers could hear them.

With a fuzzy pink paw Peck beckoned the others out of the tent to get a closer listen. The conversation crescendoed, as much as light whispering can do so, as the phantoms passed obliviously by the tent. Liza strained her ears and listened for anything clear enough to comprehend. Something about the phantom king.

Something about an uprising.

The alphas filed out of the tent one by one with feather-light motions – the shortest a pink bunny who owed half her height to the length of her ears, and the largest a mighty tiger with a cape the color of blood flowing from his back. As Liza squinted into the inscrutable shapes hidden among the underbrush, she realized that it wasn’t phantoms she was following. It was ''one'' phantom, vaguely purple in color, accompanied by two armadillo lizards who seemed to feel confident enough in their shadowed surroundings to let their tails lash noisily through the grass and bushes as they went.

Liza’s grip quivered on the hedge branch she’d pulled away to get a better look at her targets. It had been over two decades since the phantoms conducted a raid that stole lizards from their homelands of Jamaa and displaced them in the Phantom Dimension, but some of those lizards had chosen to save their own lives by joining the phantom cause – and now their hatchlings, born in the fortress, were forced to grow up mistreated and educated in the ways of evil.

“He had the nerve to assign half my students to lower fortress defense after the ''king'' ordered me to report to him about how well the schooling progress was coming along,” the phantom spat. “Some high-and-mighty general. It’s one thing that he’s been awful at strategy for as long as he’s had the job, but it’s another that he can’t even utilize the talent of all the young phantoms I work my tentacles off to train!”

One of the lizards spoke up. His colors seemed to shift every time a beam of moonlight struck him in a gap between the tree canopies, but the malicious glow in his eyes was constant. “He’s just digging his own grave, Miss Julie,” he reassured her. “Now they have one more reason to help you supplant him. He clearly doesn’t see how valuable they are… and soon that mistake will kill him.”

“Not quite, Skip,” the phantom, Julie, replied with a mischievous grin. “''We’ll'' kill him. And ''they’ll'' be right behind me.”

Then they shuffled off behind the cover of a tree with wilting branches and their faint whispers were reduced to nothingness. Liza glanced back and forth between the alphas’ shocked faces and the spot where the phantom and lizards had disappeared as if asking them whether they had heard the same conversation she did.

Receiving nods from the others, Liza stepped forward to keep following them – and tripped on a spiny green boomseed that was half-buried in the forest floor. The woods had been as quiet as if it weren’t being patrolled by six alphas, two lizards, and a phantom, but her brief yelp of alarm seemed to her as loud as a tree crashing into the grass.

Up ahead, Julie’s agitated breaths came quicker until at last she burst through the bushes and was face to face with the leaders of the phantoms’ common enemy: the alphas.

“Dragon! Skip!” Julie shouted. The two armadillo lizards scrambled to her side and bared their teeth. Liza gripped her staff, but looking at the phantom’s henchmen made her heart break. ''They should’ve been born here, in Jamaa, in a place where they would be loved and protected. But I can’t just let them go.''

Before she could even get to her paws, however, Julie’s eye began to glow a pale shade of lavender. Without warning, a ring of purple fire erupted from the earth and surrounded the six alphas. The blazes roared and grew, threatening to singe anyone who got too close, while Julie closed her eye and circled two tentacles in the air.

“She’s summoning a phantom portal!” Liza cried out, trying to reach her staff through the flames and blast Julie while she was focused, but the lizard called Skip jumped in front of her and raced down the end of the staff like a squirrel darting across a twig. The alphas struggled for space as Skip leaped off and circled them threateningly, the ring of fire closing in on them.

The last things Liza remembered were hearing Julie shout with triumph, watching a row of phantoms pour out of the portal she had grown, and choking on the toxic purple smoke before her vision went blurry and her mind slipped into darkness.

Liza almost thought she had dreamed it all when she woke up on smooth ground, something she hadn’t done since the phantoms had declared a renewed war on Jamaa and the tiger troopers’ makeshift tents became her new place of slumber every night. But as she rubbed the morning tiredness out of her eyes and pushed herself into a sitting position, she realized that the cold purple floor was very real, and so were the metal bars that trapped her there.

She gasped, gripping the bars and glancing around the room. None of the other alphas were in sight. The phantoms had confiscated her staff, her satchel, her camera… anything that could’ve helped her escape or capture information about the phantom fortress’s interior.

But what the phantoms didn’t know was that each of the alphas had the ability to communicate with the others by speaking inside their heads. The first thing Liza did after surveying what the phantoms had stolen was send a message to her five friends. ''Are you guys alright?''

''Liza!'' That was Peck. The excited emotions packed with her response gave Liza a mild headache. ''You’re alive! But where are you?''

''The rest of us are in separate prison cells in the same room, but we can’t see'' you ''anywhere,'' explained Cosmo, the alpha of the koalas. ''We thought- well, we were worried-''

''No, I’m okay, but the phantoms took almost all of my stuff. I can’t see any of you either… maybe they wanted to separate me because I’m the chief alpha?''

''That would make sense,'' Graham put in. ''Maybe they just want to make sure that all six of us aren’t together, even if some of us have to be. Maybe there’s not enough room to separate them.'' Liza shuddered at the latter idea. The phantoms had taken so many prisoners over the last year… how would they continue to make room for new ones once they ran completely out of space?

She felt so helpless. She and her fellow alphas had been held prisoner by phantoms once or twice during raids when they were unlucky enough to be caught off guard – but never had she been closer to the phantom fortress than looking at it from a close but safe distance. Now she was trapped inside it with nothing and no one to help any of the alphas escape, and all because she tripped over a boomseed.

''How are we going to get out of here?'' Peck asked through the alphas’ telepathic link. ''It’s not like we can offer anything to let them set us free. What if we get used as hostages? What if the jammers agree to something really bad to try and get us back?''

''We can’t let them,'' Sir Gilbert growled. Liza couldn’t help but admire his courage; he was always setting an example for the other jammers when it came to facing down phantoms with every drop of bravery they could muster.

''But then what can'' we ''do?'' Cosmo asked miserably. ''I haven’t got my staff either. They took Peck’s paintbrush, too; I guess they remembered it can turn into a sword.''

''Very smart of them,'' Peck said with a begrudging tone. ''They must’ve watched some of their friends get busted by my awesomely killer strokes. Hmph! Now none of us can use our powers because these stupid cells are magic-proof.''

Liza scanned the room. There was another cell beside her own, but it was empty. The sound of rumbling phantom pipes far below the prison tower kept the quiet from buzzing in her ears. Dark purple walls surrounded the tiny circular room without so much as a single banner to decorate it.

''We can’t,'' she thought quietly. ''But someone else can.''

Waves of confusion rolled into Liza’s head from almost all of the other alphas. ''How do you mean?'' Sir Gilbert asked her.

''I don’t know how long we’ll be in here, and when or if we’ll get out.'' Liza stared into her paws. The dark-gray fingerless gloves were bruised with dirt marks from when she fell in the woods. ''But Jamaa can’t stop fighting just because we’re not there. We need to ask Mira and Zios to take away our alpha powers and give them to six new animals of their choosing, at least until we’re free again and able to keep leading and fighting, because they’re no use to us while we’re imprisoned here. But it will take some time for them to find the ones who deserve those powers… so we can’t delay.''

There was a shocked silence in Liza’s brain for a few seconds. Then Greely, the wolf alpha, spoke: ''Your idea is a very noble one, Liza. Our abilities as alphas are a mere part of the massive resistance that Jamaa has been conducting for years, but they are simply too great for the war to be fought without.''

''I agree,'' said Peck. ''There are so many brave and kind jammers out there. Surely six of them will be able to take on our magic!''

''Mira and Zios chose well when they selected each of us and gifted us with fractions of their own powers to use as our own,'' Sir Gilbert agreed proudly. ''I trust that they will choose well again.''

Cosmo had no doubts either. ''I’m on board. I bet the new alphas will do so well while we’re gone that it’ll hardly seem like we’re not there fighting alongside them!''

''Me as well,'' said Graham, ''but how are we going to get Mira and Zios to hear us? How can we be sure they’re watching?''

''We just have to have faith,'' Liza replied. ''If we all concentrate together, they might just hear us…''

And she knew in moments that she had been heard, because her power to speak to the others in her mind faded away. All she could do was hope that Jamaa would welcome and fight well alongside its new alphas, and that this wasn’t the last time she’d ever hear the voices of her friends.

==Chapter One - Strays - Audrey’s POV==
Phantoms were coming.

That was all Audrey was told before her owner, Loafie, scooped her up with her friend Halo and plopped the two of them on her back. There was no time to gather more than a blanket and a small pouch of fruit and bread. Halo, a teal on cream armadillo lizard, fired question after question at Loafie, but she couldn’t answer him.

That’s what he does whenever he’s nervous, Audrey knew. Ask a lot of questions. And she hated when Halo was nervous, because it always meant he had a good reason.

Loafie saw the eight-tentacled creatures coming first. They advanced over the hills toward Jamaa Township, not quite as organized as army ranks but just as intimidating, with a larger phantom wearing a war helmet in their lead.

“They’re just here to scare us,” Loafie said. But the way the gray-and-cream fox stared back at her small house den as she fled the approaching enemy made Audrey wonder if the attack would affect the three of them beyond just a little bit of fright.

Tucked beneath the blanket on Loafie’s back were Audrey and Halo, shivering from more than the mid-autumn chill. “Where are we going?” Halo asked. Loafie just shook her head, panting as her puffs of breath became heavier with each bound. Four paws thrummed for twelve on the dusty path in time with her pounding heartbeat.

“Don’t worry, Halo. We’ll be okay,” Audrey reassured him. “Loafie always knows what to do.”

Loafie stumbled on twigs rooted in the ground as the land gradually became wooded where Jamaa Township faded into Sarepia Forest. Most of the phantoms had broken off from the group that was chasing her at this point, but some of them clearly enjoyed watching a jammer run away from them.

Suddenly, a proto-phantom popped up out of a bush Loafie was approaching. The lizards dug their tiny claws into her back to hold on while she skidded to a halt in the grass. She had sped forward so fast that the small round phantom busted, but it slowed her down enough that the other phantoms finally caught up.

“No!” Loafie gasped. Her head whirled around looking for ways to escape, but her indecision had left her surrounded. The phantoms chattered and cackled at her, watching her dart around in panic before a pair of heavy phantoms hauled out a giant cage.

Her ice-blue gaze flitted all over the field until she finally spotted a way out: a small tunnel leading from a dirt patch down into a dark hole. It was too many paces away to see what was underneath, and it was definitely too small for a fox to fit… but it was the perfect size for a pair of lizards.

Loafie jerked forward so that Audrey and Halo tumbled onto her tail and into the grass. “Get into the pouch!” she ordered them. Halo stared at her with wide red x-eyes, not moving despite the desperation in her voice, but Audrey took him by the arm and dived in among the apples and bread while Loafie bundled it up inside the blanket.

“Halo, come on,” Audrey whispered frantically. “We have to-”

Before she could finish, the two lizards were catapulted through the air, whizzing past a number of phantoms with startled expressions and then landing in front of a hole in the ground. It was Audrey’s turn to look back at Loafie in disbelief, but when her owner screeched “''Run''”, she knew she and Halo had no choice. Audrey shoved Halo into the tunnel first and squeezed the food pouch in after him, and once he had pulled the pouch far enough into the tunnel, she followed him with the blanket wrapped around her middle.

“Forget the lizards!” she heard one of the phantoms shout to its comrades. “They’ll be back for this one.” The tunnel was too narrow for Audrey to turn around, and the blanket that blocked the entrance muffled sounds from aboveground, but she was certain she heard metal snap shut against metal.

Halo heard it too. He turned his head as much as the width of the tunnel would let him, and Audrey saw tears glittering in his eyes. “She’s alive, Halo,” Audrey told him softly. “We have to be alive too if we want to get her back.” The words struck her as silly the moment they left her mouth. The phantom army was so ''big.'' How would two tiny lizards be able to find their owner, much less help her escape from Jamaa’s most infamous enemy?

The teal-and-cream lizard didn’t respond. He just shook his head and kept dragging the pouch through an endless corridor of dirt.

As they went, Audrey noticed that the tunnels branched off in many places. No matter how she squinted at them, however, it was impossible to see anything inside them. The whole underground system seemed to have been dug so close to the surface of the earth that she could still clearly smell every flower and fallen drop of phantom goop that passed by over their heads. She was grateful for whatever had caused them to be that way; the very idea of going any deeper into the seemingly-endless dark made her queasy.

Either one of the lizards could have sworn that entire cycles of the moon had passed before a light finally illuminated their way. Halo gasped when he saw it and began lugging the fruit behind him twice as quickly as before. “Be careful it doesn’t fall out!” Audrey shouted after him, but he barely seemed to listen.

The tunnel sloped upwards at last, opening out into a clearing surrounded by a ring of pine trees and carpeted with pine needles… and populated with more armadillo lizards than Audrey could count.

Halo, whose head had popped out of the hole, saw all the unfamiliar pairs of eyes staring at him and scrambled backwards into the tunnel in a panic. “Don’t back up!” Audrey yelped as the pouch got smushed up against her face.

“It’s alright.” A pastel lizard, her scales pink on blue, emerged from the crowd. “We don’t bite.”

A second lizard, larger and with scales of red and gold, stepped forward beside her and smirked. “Unless you’re a phantom, but you only half look like one.”

Halo instinctively looked down at himself and glared at the red lizard, but he hauled himself out of the hole and pulled the bread-and-food pouch behind him with his teeth. “Do you need any help?” the first lizard asked him, but he regarded her with a look of distrust and ignored her outstretched claws.

Audrey was grateful for the help, however, and let the stranger lift her back up to ground level. Her white blanket – Loafie’s – was now soiled from rubbing up against the dirt walls of the tunnels. “I’ll wash that for you,” said the lizard who had helped her up. “I’m Haylee, by the way.”

“That’s okay, I can wash it,” Audrey said instinctively, even though she didn’t have a clue where the nearest source of clean water was. Her social personality kicked in and she continued. “I’m Audrey. And this is my friend Halo.”

She noticed that Halo frowned a bit when she called him her friend. ''Why’s he upset, I wonder? We’ve only known each other for a year since Loafie adopted him,'' Audrey thought to herself. ''I’m not sure I can go around calling him a brother or anything just yet. Although if we’re going to be out here without Loafie, maybe this will be what tests our bond as adopted siblings. Or… something like that.''

“Well, Audrey, Halo,” Haylee said with a smile. “You made it. Welcome to the Defenders of Jamaa.”

==Chapter Two - Snow - Audrey’s POV==
“The… Defenders of Jamaa?” Halo echoed Haylee’s words, puzzled.

“That’s right!” A black lizard with bright yellow-green facial scales piped up. “We’re the largest all-lizard anti-phantom resistance effort in Jamaa.” He looked down at his claws. “Not like we have much competition, but there’s still a good number of us left!” Audrey tried to survey the size of the assembled lizards with her eyes, guessing that there were at least sixty of them, each with unique colors and eye shapes.

Haylee’s ear twitched when he said the word “left.” “Thank you, Toxic,” she told him halfheartedly. “Some of the group is out gathering right now, so you’re not looking at every one of us.” She pointed her tail at a purple and green lizard who stood behind her. “My sister’s one of the gatherers. She saw the two of you in trouble and went to tell us.”

That made Halo’s shoulders tense up behind his head. “She saw us?” His tail lashed with accusation at the shape of Haylee’s sister. “Why didn’t you even try to save Loafie when it was obvious we needed help?”

“She was alone,” Haylee cut in with a stern tone, “and, according to her- what did you say again?”

“There were too many phantoms there for even ''five'' lizards to be able to fight off,” Kaylee said softly. Audrey examined the tension in her arms and how her head was lowered beside her sister’s. She doubted she’d be hearing much from this lizard, but that didn’t mean she had nothing to say.

Halo exhaled. “Okay. I’m sorry. I’m just not used to having my owner ripped away from me with zero warning, and now I don’t know what to do.”

“You’re welcome to stay with us for a while,” Haylee said with a sympathetic blink of her pale-blue eyes. “We move around a lot, but for the time being, our home is in a bunker a bit deeper into Sarepia Forest.” She swept her tail at the other members of the Defenders of Jamaa. “A lot of these guys have lost their owners, too. Right now we’re focused on giving a home to lizards who have been displaced in the phantom attacks and launching surprise attacks on phantom spy parties, but with just a little more time and training, we’ll be ready to launch a full-scale invasion on the phantom fortress and take back their owners for good.”

Many of the lizards behind Haylee cheered at her words. Some were shifting their claws and ripping up the grass, clearly eager to bust some phantoms. They all looked so different in their sizes and appearances and colors – but to Audrey, that made their united determination all the more beautiful.

Audrey glanced questioningly at Halo, and turned back to Haylee when he gave her a nod. “We’ll join you.”

The lizards shouted again with excitement. The red-and-gold lizard gave her and Halo a suspicious eye, but she stepped back when Haylee invited them to the Defenders’ barracks.

It wasn’t a long trek from the clearing to the next hole in the ground. “In five weeks’ time, all this will be covered in four inches of snow,” Toxic told Audrey, sweeping his black-and-neon tail through the pine needles.

Audrey loved the snow. She fondly remembered the couple months when it finally started getting cold, right before the Jamaalidays were in full swing, begging Loafie to stock up on Cosmo’s Famous hot cocoa mix. Every time she asked, Loafie would tell her it was too early, but on a different day each year she would come home from her trading errands with an arm full of the containers and Audrey would dance all around the living room at the sight.

When Halo was adopted, she remembered him teasing her for putting cinnamon in her drink, but one time she dared him to take a sip of her cocoa and he decided he loved it. In the years that followed, the two lizards would beg their owner not only for hot cocoa, but warm cinnamon powder as well, to continue their tradition.

Given how scrappy the lizards in the group looked, though they all seemed generally happy, Audrey guessed there wasn’t any cinnamon in their bunker. Or hot chocolate. She frowned at the earth as it passed slowly underneath her.

Halo sensed her sudden change in emotions and hurried to her side. “Don’t worry,” he told her, seeming to start accepting that he would have to live with these lizards for who knew how long. “It could be worse. We could be in the phantoms’ prison. And then there would be no one to free Loafie, because what if everyone here just wants to save their own owners? Or maybe we’d just be dead.”

His gaze dropped to the point where Audrey was staring. “Maybe a few weeks on our own will do that to us. We’ve never been on our own before.”

“Halo, always the optimist,” Audrey said sarcastically. She flicked her tail over his shoulder comfortingly. “We’re not alone. We have the Defenders now.”

She glanced at the pouch of food Loafie had packed for the two of them, which was now slung over her back. “We might not have much right now, but they want to protect us. And if we help them, maybe even make some friends…” Audrey smiled as Halo rolled his eyes at the idea. “They might just help us free Loafie. And don’t you like the idea of helping do the same for other lizards’ owners?”

Halo snorted. “I still don’t think that they would lift a claw for ''us'' had you not told them we were joining. The leader’s sister left us to fend for ourselves. She ran away while Loafie was fighting for her life!”

“Shhh, keep your voice down,” Audrey tried to calm him. Toxic had trotted ahead, but he turned his head back and smiled at them. He seemed like the kind of lizard who would welcome them and help them get Loafie back.

It was going to be difficult to tell who to trust with how suddenly she and Halo had been thrust into a world without their owner, but Audrey was determined to give the Defenders a chance. ''Maybe I’ll learn a thing or two here,'' Audrey thought. ''Maybe they know how to fight back against the phantoms or teach self-defense or throw boomseeds. Or how to make hot cocoa mix out of dirt...''

==Chapter Three - Spy - Halo’s POV==
There was nothing but a round dent in the ground to signify the entrance to another tunnel. “Just so you know, it’s a little tight in here, so make sure you go single file,” Haylee called back to Audrey and Halo. “It’s the best way to make sure phantoms can’t wander in.”

Lizards scurried into the hole in a neat line, tail-to-tail, like a row of ants on a log. Halo was about to shuffle his way in when he was stopped by a red arm with three dark-gold claws blocking his way. “You two are gonna hang back with me,” the red-and-gold lizard who had teased him earlier growled.

He narrowed his eyes at her, but stepped aside from the lizards who were entering the tunnel and Audrey sat confused beside him. The lizard Haylee had called Toxic whooped and cannonballed into the hole, much to the annoyance of those waiting behind him, but Audrey chuckled at him. Halo scowled at the black-and-neon lizard as his bright tail-tip disappeared underground.

It was impossible not to notice, as more and more lizards went by and disappeared into the hole, that the red lizard was unarguably the buffest one in the group, or that Halo had ever seen. Her nose was tilted just a little bit higher than Halo’s – maybe that was her personality, he guessed – but her arms were like redwood trunks and looked just as solid. If the shade of her scales was like blood after it had dried, her eyes resembled the color when it was fresh.

Finally, she, Halo, and Audrey were the last ones remaining who hadn’t yet dived into the hole. Audrey was simply staring at everything the stranger had to stare at until she snapped her head back to them. “Marlenka,” she introduced herself with a chilly tone. Her voice was deep, much unlike the tunnels or Halo’s respect for her or anything else in the immediate area worth the comparison.

“You two are definitely new. And I assume the scouts weren’t lying about where you came from, because both Kaylee ''and'' Raimu said they saw what happened.” She said “what happened” so stoically that Halo wanted to claw her eyes out, but he forced himself to contain his feelings, at least as long as Audrey was around. He couldn’t risk acting up in front of his crush of six months.

“There’s a spy in the group.” She said it like this discovery was something that happened every other week. Halo shifted closer to Audrey, trying to send her a silent question: ''Why are you so willing to stay in a group like this when we could be looking for Loafie?''

Audrey tilted her head at Marlenka. “Why tell us?”

“I’ve told every lizard who joined the group within the last six months or so because I need as many eyes on the situation as possible and it’s unlikely that any new recruits would be involved in it.” Marlenka glanced back at the tunnel entrance to make sure no one was lingering there. “We’ve had to move around an unimaginable amount of times this year. There’s no way it’s a coincidence; someone is definitely relaying our location to the phantoms. You see…”

Marlenka traced a claw in front of the entrance and then covered it up again with pine needles. “We have several underground bunkers all over the eight lands of Jamaa. When we get found by the phantoms, we often have to leave our stuff behind, but then there’s always a pre-made bunker waiting for us to move into. We used to be able to go a few months before they’d discover us living under there, but now it just takes a couple weeks… and the timing always feels ''too'' perfect.”

Halo sniffed. “Shouldn’t it be easy to keep track of who’s leaving the bunkers frequently and at the right time to suggest they’re telling the phantoms everything? I don’t see why you need to drag every new recruit into this.”

“You wanna keep track of that, on top of all the gatherers and messengers who are ''supposed'' to be sent out? Good luck, and thanks for the load off.” Marlenka clapped Halo on the back so hard he nearly fell over. “Dinnertime. You don’t want to miss it.”

Halo just proceeded into the tunnel without looking back at her, shaking his head as he went. Audrey was about to follow him, but Marlenka lifted her head. “You seem like the observant type,” she commented, and then she squeezed into the tunnel after Audrey, leaving the purple-and-silver lizard to follow her.

The tunnel was composed of damp dirt underneath Halo’s claws, which wasn’t the most pleasant surface to walk on, but once it opened out into an underground room most of the floor was covered in ragged red carpets. A little ways away, lizards were laughing and conversing at a long table made from natural wood with the bark shaved off.

Looking over his shoulder, Halo could see that Audrey was amazed. Halo had to begrudgingly admit – though not out loud, of course – that it was incredible how the lizards made a home like this out of so little. Back at Loafie’s den, all the furniture and decorations were gargantuan, proportioned for a fox, but in the hall everything was perfectly lizard-sized. Little wooden sconces lined the walls, lit with a tiny bit of fire, and cast circles of light on the sides of the room that inhaled and exhaled with every motion of the flame. Some of the younger lizards seemed to be playing a version of “the floor is lava” – or dirt, rather – while skipping across the carpets on the way to the dining hall.

“This place is amazing,” Audrey breathed once she had caught up to Halo. “Look how there are so many other tunnels coming out from this room.” They leaned to see into the nearest one and saw a few rows of neat leafy beds. Some of them looked as lush and green as if it were still summertime, but others were drying up and the leaves inside were crinkled like the ones on the trees up above.

Behind them, Marlenka cleared her throat. “Exsqueeze me.” She shouldered her way past Halo and Audrey as they pressed themselves up against the wall. Once she had her head into the larger room, she turned it around and looked at them. “Come on, eat. We have seven metric tons of crap you can stuff your cheeks with.”

“Do you have any… strawberries?” asked Halo.

“I don’t know,” Marlenka said flatly. “Do you guys like chocolate cake?”

==Chapter Four - Welcome - Bella’s POV==
Bella watched the two newcomers join the rest of the Defenders for dinner in the great hall. When she first saw them, she felt a kind of vicarious joy at watching them be accepted, but at the same time, how happy could she really be when only two lizards had ever greeted her with that same enthusiasm?

Her parents back in the phantom fortress would tell her to push those feelings down. Push down the happiness so that it doesn’t get in the way of your thoughts, and push down the sadness so that you can harness it later.

“I think we should tell our brand-new members about the Mt. Shiveer raid in two days,” Haylee began over the loud sounds of chewing and slurping.

“Yes, that,” Marlenka agreed. “Not sure if it needs to be a dinner discussion. Only a few of us are supposed to go. Seven or less, since the messengers said there weren’t many finished prisons yet or phantoms working on them.”

Toxic piped up. “''So'' it’ll be a nice chance for them to show their loyalty if they come along!”

A bright-yellow solid lizard suddenly sat up from his chair and sang at the top of his lungs, “''RUN AWAY FROM THE HUMDRUM!!''” Another solid-yellow lizard, this one daffodil-colored, promptly slapped him right in the face.

“Hey, no,” Haylee stopped them. “Big Bird, Banana, sit down. And I’m not going to force anyone to come on a dangerous mission if they don’t want to. Because the mission involves going to a cold place and likely interacting with phantoms, it should really be their choice if they decided to go. Nobody needs to prove anything to anyone.”

Marlenka grunted. “Speak for yourself,” she muttered under her breath. Bella’s scales seemed to turn to ice as she watched the red-and-gold lizard swing her head down into a lava cake. Haylee had always been kind to her, and stuck up for her when the other lizards looked at her sideways, but Marlenka had done nothing but the opposite.

Every time she even glanced in Bella’s direction, she felt blades of festering suspicion whizzing past her ears. At least, Bella thought to herself, she had accepted that she would never gain the red lizard’s trust. And at this point, she didn’t care to overexert herself trying to earn it.

In response to what Haylee said, Toxic glanced at the newest members of the group. “Well, I’ll be going along if either of you wanted to come,” he offered. “Cakepop?”

“Yeah!” a pink-and-tan lizard responded almost instantly. “You know I’ll be there!”

“I had asked Haylee if I could come yesterday,” said a lizard with pale purple scales named Eira. “Is that still alright with you?”

Haylee smiled. “Mhm. And I know Raimu wanted to be on the mission too. So if that makes six of us with Marlenka, since she’s basically in charge of all the scratchy clawy stuff, we probably just need one more.”

The other lizards turned to look at Audrey and Halo, who sat at the designated spot for new Defenders at the end of the table. Bella knew she wasn’t going to volunteer, even if Marlenka was going. There were only two lizards in the entire group who she bothered to get to know, and they were Haylee and Millie.

Millie never went on missions anymore, since she was older and had been a Defender for all three years of the group’s existence; Haylee, the founder and putative leader (although she rejected that title officially) considered her to have done enough of a share over the years to stop working and just live with the Defenders, but Millie insisted on helping take care of the younger lizards whenever possible. Bella saw her looking her way from across the table, but she just shook her head politely. This raid just wasn’t for her.

Halo was doing a terrible job trying to send nonverbal signals to Audrey. His head shook as noticeably as possible in her direction, making him look like he was sitting in a massage chair or experiencing an electric shock, but Audrey didn’t get the message. “Don’t worry about it,” she told Haylee. “I’d love to go with you.”

The others who would be in the raid party voiced their excitement and toasted glasses of fruit juice, stretching out like scaly elastic bands to clink rims with lizards on the other sides of the table. Bella watched Halo turn his head away with a look of frustration on his face. She couldn’t blame him; she’d feel the same way if she had to be alone in the barracks with both Millie and Haylee gone.

But up until that afternoon, Halo had had an owner. He had somebody who both loved and wanted him for at least some of his life. And he didn’t even come to the Defenders alone. Bella sunk her dark-purple claws into the chair cushion. It was ''selfish'' of him to ignore all this attention just because his friend wanted to go on a mission that he didn’t. No one was treating him like a plague because of where he came from.

She stared into the shiny green grapes on her plate, the same color as her eyes, and watched the reflection move around as she turned her head. She knew if she refused to look up at the Defenders chatting up Audrey and Halo and getting to know them with a genuine kind of eagerness, maybe her tears had a chance of staying put.

==Chapter Five - Book - Audrey’s POV==
Audrey’s stomach was more than full once dinner was over. Haylee sent out groups of lizards to scout around the area and had Toxic and some others clean up the table for the next meal. Once again it warmed her heart to see such a diverse mix of age groups working together, even if one of the extreme ends just meant hatchlings licking up bread crumbs underneath the long wooden table.

She decided to approach Haylee after she had finished receiving the previous set of scouts and gatherers from their outdoor ventures. “Yes,” Haylee said, although it barely sounded like a question and was paired with a heavy exhale.

“Is there anything I can do to help?” Audrey tilted her head at the pink-and-blue lizard.

Haylee thought for a moment. “Well, all the scouting patrols are out, and we don’t need to gather until the morning. But maybe you could poke around in the storage room and see if you can find any supplies that will help us for the mission tomorrow. Blankets or spades or something. You’d be surprised what useful things get left in the bunkers when we move burrows,” she added with a wistful smile. Audrey wondered if she was still looking for something important that she’d been forced to leave behind.

“Marlenka can go with you. ''Marlenka!''” The red and gold lizard swung her head around and lumbered forward.

“What.”

Haylee pointed with her tail toward another dark tunnel branching out from the great hall. “Could you help Audrey look for stuff for the mission in the storage room?”

“I don’t know, could I?”

The pink lizard sighed. “Marlenka, ''may'' you. Please.”

Marlenka’s mouth twitched up into a smile for a split second. “Well, thank you for asking so nicely. C’mon, Purple.” She bumped Audrey’s shoulder and squeezed into the tunnel. A short and silent walk later, during which Audrey could sense they were getting much further underground, they stopped in front of a door labeled “STORAGE” with a wooden sign hanging loosely from a peg. The rope attached to it, which seemed to be made of pure sawdust, looked thin enough that it could snap and drop the sign to the ground at any moment.

“I’m not going in there,” Marlenka said.

Audrey smirked at her. “What, are there spiders in here? Are you afraid of spiders?”

Marlenka’s nose scrunched up. “Mice are the major problem, actually. But I’m tired and big and bound to knock crap over, so why would I bother.” She shrugged and began backing out of the tight passage with a remarkable lack of claustrophobia. “Have fun digging through useless garbage. Don’t know what’s been stowed away here, but all I know is my heart spear is somewhere back in the southern Coral Canyons bunker, and I haven’t seen the ol’ redrock arch in eight months and counting.” With a huff, she finally pulled herself out of the entrance and disappeared from sight of the entrance, presumably to find a more suitable place to collapse.

Audrey wandered through the door, turning her head in such a way that it felt like her neck had rusted over. There was nothing menacing about this place except for a lack of brightness and too much to look at – the only light came from a cluster of lava lamps slumped against one another in the corner of the room. She inspected the pile and, sensing no mice in her immediate accidental-grabbing range, picked up one of the flickering lamps and carried it like a torch.

The room was much taller than the corridor that had led to it, which Audrey figured was the reason the tunnel had sloped so steeply downward into the earth. Tall shelves on wheels lined the sides of the room and filled the vast space in the middle, their lowest platforms crusted with dried dirt but the contents atop them mostly clean. She saw everything from broken plates to tools to actual torches with burnt ends on display. And near the center of the room: blankets.

Audrey let out a breath of relief and let her lava lamp’s weak blue glow guide her to the shelf. The blankets were a few levels up, but she could always climb…

Reluctantly, she set down the lava lamp on the ground and hoisted herself up onto the chilly metal pole that supported one corner of the shelf. It was no surface that made crawling up it easy, but the level she needed to reach was way too high to jump up to. Before long, Audrey had reached a point where she had climbed too high to risk looking down, and she had passed more than a few levels of the shelf containing objects that no amount of squinting could make clear in the dark.

At last, she reached a level with something fuzzy and soft hanging over the edge. Audrey grabbed onto it, expecting to be able to hoist herself up, but nearly fell all the way back down the pole when it squeaked and scurried out from under her claws. “Jeez!” she hissed under her breath. After waiting a few more seconds to see if any more blanket-resembling critters would escape, Audrey swung back on the pole to gain momentum and then vaulted onto the shelf platform where the blankets were waiting.

Just in case, she swept her tail over the blankets to chase out invisible mice, expecting at least one or two more to dart out, but hit something that was clearly hard. “What…” she muttered and turned around to see what she had knocked against. Blankets were piled on top of one another all over this level of the shelf, but one of them had a square shape vaguely visible underneath it with corners too rigid to be a folded cloth.

Audrey peered at it with curious eyes. At that point, it wouldn’t have shocked her if the four-sided shape sprouted legs and ran away, but it didn’t. When she ripped away the blanket laid on top of it, what stared back at her with several pairs of illustrated armadillo lizards’ eyes was a book titled ''The Secret Talents of the Lizards.''

==Chapter Six - Secret - Audrey’s POV==
The book seemed to glow as Audrey picked it up. When she turned open the solid cover, she realized that the contents were written with some kind of iridescent ink that put the undependable luminosity of the lava lamp to shame. And it was definitely written and not printed; the lettering was far from perfect, and Audrey found herself subconsciously avoiding touching the pages as much as possible in case the glimmering ink smeared on the paper.

It was no thick volume, but what Audrey read in the table of contents made up for any resulting disappointment. There was a section for abilities to control each of the four cardinal elements – air, water, earth, and fire – and additional chapters dedicated to other types of magic that were entirely different. “''Alpha influence on lizard magic,''” Audrey read aloud, puzzled. “I ought to take a look at that one. And what’s this one about wings?”

Soon she was curled up in a not-so-neat pile of blankets, her back legs dangling over the edge of the shelf platform, flipping through information about elements and how armadillo lizards had the unique power to harness them. “There,” she muttered once she found the part she was looking for about how alpha magic affected lizard magic.

“Though alpha magic is most likely disconnected from the elemental powers of armadillo lizards,” she read off the page, “it has been proposed that the possession of alpha powers can grant a lizard powers of a specific additional element, or heightened elemental powers if the lizard is already in possession of that element. Only one lizard, though now deceased, has ever held the title of alpha before: Baylee, Alpha of Magic, Protector of Lizards, and Visitor of Lizard Heroes.”

Suddenly intensely interested, even though she knew none of the alphas were lizards, Audrey looked through a table of alpha types and what element they corresponded to, alongside a written explanation. “Alphas are categorized by the animal species whose heartstone they possess, in addition to a unique magic type. The six alpha types are moon, sun, magic, technology, nature, and phantom. The elements they are thought to add to a lizard alpha’s existing power given their alpha type are as follows: earth to nature, fire to sun and technology, water to magic, and air to moon and phantom.” She frowned at the table. “Huh. I never knew the alphas had ''types'' before…”

She flipped forward some more until she reached the chapter that was all about wings. It caught her eye as soon as she reached it, since the pages were decorated with several detailed illustrations of wings.

Audrey kept reading quietly to herself. “In addition to elemental powers, each lizard has the ability to summon a unique pair of wings that will typically draw their coloring from the lizard’s scales. Summoning the wings takes usually up to five seconds for a lizard who has practiced the skill, and they will automatically disappear once the lizard reaches the ground after using their wings to fly.”

This book really did contain secrets about the talents of lizards, Audrey thought. All of this information was completely new to her. A lizard alpha? Elemental powers? ''Wings?'' Her excitement at the knowledge was curbed by a question: ''What do I do with this book?''

Putting it back under the blanket was hardly an option now. Who knew how old the book was, and whether the words inside of it were still true? But what if handing it over to Haylee was a wrong move somehow?

''No,'' Audrey decided. ''Giving it to Haylee means giving it to someone who would probably have a better idea of what to do with these secrets than I do. And this book was in this bunker, in this storage room. It can only be property of the Defenders.''

In the back of Audrey’s brain, she was still so wrapped up in the fantasy idea of powers and flight that she felt like jumping from the shelf to see if wings would appear and carry her to the floor, but she restrained herself and slid down the metal pole with the book and three blankets tucked over her back.

When she emerged from the tunnel, Audrey saw Haylee was the only one left in the previously bustling dinner hall. She was in the process of folding the red plaid tablecloth with claws that moved as slowly as her drooping eyelids. Hearing Audrey call her name startled her back awake.

“Sorry to wake you,” Audrey said, trotting over to Haylee’s side. “Should I come back in the morning?”

Haylee shook her head and rubbed her sky-blue eyes. “No, it’s fine. Oh, hey, you found some blankets. Thank you.”

Audrey tilted to the side so that the cargo slid off her back. “Blankets, and… this.” As gingerly as possible, she reached into the blanket pile and pulled out the book. “It was right by the shelf where I found the blankets. I figured you might have lost this sometime during a move.”

But judging by Haylee’s starry-eyed reaction, that wasn’t the case. “No, I’ve never seen this book before. ‘''The Secret Talents of the Lizards''’?”

Audrey nodded and opened the book. “It’s got a whole bunch of stuff in it. Magic and wings and-”

She was stopped by the sound of claws hitting the dirt. Audrey looked up sharply. “What was that?” she whispered.

A purple-and-green lizard with big blue eyes appeared in the tunnel. “Sorry,” she said quietly. “I can’t sleep. I tried looking in your nest, but I couldn’t find you.”

Haylee smiled at her sister. “Don’t worry, Kaylee, I’ll be there in a few minutes.” In her mind, Audrey was grateful that Kaylee didn’t even seem to glance at the book. It made her guilty, considering she trusted Haylee and this was her sister, but the book’s contents made their secrecy seem all too important to stay between only those who needed to know until Haylee decided otherwise.

“Sorry about that,” Haylee said to Audrey once Kaylee had nodded and disappeared again. “She does that often. Our owner got captured by phantoms three years ago, and, well… It really hit her hard. So I do what I can to stay by her side and make sure she knows I care about her.”

“That’s sweet of you,” Audrey replied. She stared at the floor. “I hope we can both get our owners back before…” Before when? Next year? Ever? How long would it take for the Defenders to be ready to storm the phantom fortress? Haylee had already waited for three years, and what end was there in sight?

Haylee smiled at her. “We will. No matter how long it takes.” She rose to her claws and stretched out a bit. “I’ll keep the book safe in my nest for tomorrow. Maybe you, me, and Marlenka can take a closer look at it together in the morning?”

“I’d love to,” Audrey said excitedly. “Good night.”

She realized she had never picked out a place to sleep before going into the storage room, but Haylee was already down the hall to find her own nest where Kaylee was waiting. ''Oh boy. I’m so tired…'' she thought. ''I hope we can just plop down anywhere. Should’ve chosen a nest earlier…''

That little space didn’t make such an awful place to sleep. She was right near the folded tablecloth, blocking her off from sight like a little wall, and the ground was smooth and dry. In an instant she was curled up on it and peacefully dreaming she could fly.

==Chapter Seven - Leaves - Halo’s POV==
Halo had a rough time falling asleep, and by the time he woke up he guessed he didn’t get more than four hours of shuteye. When he stretched out like he always did in the morning, his tail hit branches and leaves and grass instead of the comfy fluff lining the inside of his bed back at Loafie’s den.

Also, he was surrounded by at least a dozen other lizards in the same tunnel. One of them saw him blinking awake and came over; her scales were light shades of pink and brown, and a playful ferocity sparked in her teal eyes. “Hey, Halo!” she shouted as she bounded up to him. “You snore, dude.” A couple of the other lizards chuckled.

Halo rose to his claws and glared at her while simultaneously flexing his back legs in the last of his stretching routine. This lizard was familiar to him; Toxic had referred to her as Cakepop back at the dinner table. She was one of the ones going on the stupid mission.

''Ugh.'' Thinking about dinner made his head ache. He had been surrounded by so much food – but the amount of lizards and noise in the room had made his stomach urge him not to eat, so hungry he remained. ''And Audrey didn’t even'' look ''at me when I was trying to tell her not to volunteer for the mission!''

He realized he had been so lost in his internal frustration that he was staring at Cakepop. Hurriedly he turned his head away. “Oooo, Cakepop, somebody ''liiiikes'' you!” another lizard exclaimed.

“I’m thinking about something,” Halo growled. “I didn’t mean to keep looking at-”

“Thinking about ''meeeee?''” Cakepop giggled.

Halo snorted. “You’re what, seven? Grow up a little before you start chasing after lizards who are way too old for you.”

“I’m eleven,” Cakepop corrected him with a thoughtful tone. “Which makes me like sixty years less than you.”

She and her friends giggled and scrambled away into the dinner hall before Halo could say a word. The teal-and-cream lizard ground his lower jaw against the roof of his mouth and lumbered in after them to look for Audrey.

However, the group of hatchlings in front of him stopped so abruptly that he nearly rammed straight into its back and started a reptilian domino chain. Peering over their short, spiky heads, he saw Marlenka and Haylee crouched over Audrey, who was unmoving beside the folded tablecloth that had been on the dinner table the previous night.

Marlenka prodded Audrey’s shoulder with one arm and flatly asked her, “You okay, dude?”

Halo shouldered his way through the tide of smaller lizards, causing a couple of them to bounce off the floor and yelp. “Let me through,” he snarled at them, stopping in front of Audrey.

The purple-and-silver lizard twitched and then blinked open her eyes. Her pupils contracted the second she realized she was surrounded by a bunch of other lizards who were staring at her. “What happened?” she said groggily.

“I just didn’t expect you’d fall asleep in the dinner hall, since there’s plenty of open nests you’re welcome to use,” Haylee explained and helped her up. Halo was about to tell Audrey good morning and say that he was glad she was okay, but Haylee stopped him with a stern look. “Halo, please don’t push anyone to get from place to place. We’re all on the same team.”

“Sounds like you need a new name,” one of the hatchlings giggled behind him. Halo shook his head and stomped back to his nest while Haylee scolded them for picking on him. He hated this place and all the lizards in it. Why didn’t the hatchlings’ noble, courageous, phantom-busting parents ever teach them respect?

He curled up in the grass and tucked his nose underneath the drying gold leaves, finding them less and less comfortable every time he shifted. It was hopeless to try and fit in with the Defenders, and more so to believe they had any chance of freeing Loafie even if they wanted to.

A few hours of napping gave Halo a lot of time to clear his head. While he drifted off, he had decided that if he was going to be forced to stay here so that he could stay by Audrey’s side, he would stay here comfortably.

Lizards were chatting and eating together and playing games with pebbles and sticks in the nesting rooms and the dinner hall. Halo had to poke his head into a few tunnels and witness a few questionable acts before finding Haylee re-lighting some of the wall sconces in a darkened corridor.

“Hey,” he said awkwardly, his head bent low.

Haylee regarded him with a look as friendly as if she hadn’t scolded him earlier. “Hi, Halo. What’s up? Do you need help finding something?”

“Uh, I was wondering, could I maybe become a gatherer…? I noticed that the leaves in a few of the nests were kind of… crinkly.”

The pastel lizard sighed. “Yeah. That’s the unfortunate part about autumn; there’s less leaves to replenish the ones that dry up in the nests. But sure, you can go out looking for some, and if you decide you like scavenging for leaves and maybe a few berries along the way, you could choose to become a gatherer! I’ll send Vatra to help you out.”

Halo winced. “Is there no way I could go alone?”

“Well, you probably didn’t get all that good of a look around the place on your way here to the barracks, so she can show you good spots to find trees that haven’t gone orange yet. Are you going out right now?”

He sighed. “I guess.”

“Okay, then I’ll go find her right now!” Haylee took the twig that she’d been using to light the sconces and squashed the flame into the tunnel’s dirt floor. “Let’s go.”

==Chapter Eight - Name - Audrey's POV==
Audrey watched with a pained expression as Halo stormed off back to his nest. “Shoo,” Haylee briskly told the hatchlings, who were still staring after the teal-and-cream lizard like he was made of amethysts. They giggled at one another and scattered, dispersing through the tunnels in jumbled waves.

“Don’t go into the nesting rooms!” Haylee whisper-yelled at them a little too late. “There are lizards who are still sleeping!” She sighed as their tail-tips disappeared behind every corner in sight.

“Halo’s not mean,” Audrey reassured the other two lizards. She felt bad about basically apologizing on his behalf, but she wished he was trying harder to settle in without stirring tempers. “He’s just having a hard time getting used to this environment.”

Haylee nodded. “Oh, I know. He’ll find a way to contribute to the group if he wants to. And if he doesn’t, then we as the Defenders are happy to protect him from phantoms while he stays here; that’s our mission.”

Marlenka coughed and dragged the book out from behind the folded tablecloth where Haylee had left it. “Moody newbies aside, we oughta take a peek at this thing, no?”

The other two nodded. “I had no idea that lizards have had their own powers this whole time,” Audrey said. “We can control the elements according to this thing. And fly if we concentrate the right way, or something like that.”

Haylee winked at her. “Elemental powers are something we’ve been training with for most of the Defenders’ existence. But if this book really can tell us how to gain better control of them or even summon wings, it could be a huge help the next time we come into contact with phantoms!”

“And you’re ''sure'' we didn’t own this thing?” Marlenka raised an eyebrow and pushed ''The Secret Talents of the Lizards'' in front of Audrey and Haylee. “Because I’ve never seen it before this morning, so I sure as hell didn’t stuff it away in any of the storage rooms.”

Haylee shook her head earnestly. “I have no idea how it got there either. We’re the only ones who come down in these bunkers… phantoms are too small to fit, and the night guards would notice if any of them came through. It doesn’t make sense for an enemy to have snuck this book into the storage-”

“Well, enough about how we got it and back to what’s ''inside'' it,” Marlenka snorted. “I mean, if it doesn’t work then it doesn’t work, right? Audrey already opened it. It’s not like there’ll be a bomb inside.”

The book was surprisingly clean for how old it looked, although the edges of its cover were tattered and almost clawed away. Audrey flipped back through it until she found the ''Wings'' section. “In addition to elemental powers, each lizard has the ability to summon a unique pair of wings…” she read aloud. “Summoning the wings takes usually up to five seconds… and they will automatically disappear once the lizard reaches the ground after using their wings to fly. Lizards are best at summoning wings while focusing on thoughts that lift them up or make them happy or proud.”

“Aw, jeez,” Marlenka grunted. “What’s there for ''me'' to think?”

Haylee blinked gratefully at Audrey. “You know, it’s another busy day for me. I’ve gotta check the hall torches to make sure they’re all still lit, see to a couple of concussions, ''and'' keep preparing for the mission tomorrow… but how about you two take some of the others out and see about those wings? Audrey, maybe you could learn a thing or two from them about elemental magic. I wonder what your element is.”

Audrey nodded. “Sure thing. We can do that, right, Marlenka?”

“I don’t know,” Marlenka replied. “''Can'' we?”

To avoid starting a stampede of lizards who wanted wings, Audrey and Marlenka wanted to pick out just a few of them to go outside and test the book’s words with them. Although their first thought was to collect hatchlings to experiment, Toxic overheard what they were saying and asked if he could come along. Audrey asked Big Bird if he was interested, but the solid-yellow lizard just started singing something about butterflies and zebras and circus minds.

Then she saw another purple lizard, who looked to be around her age, sitting all alone, and invited her to come. “Great! We’re going out now,” Audrey told the lizard once she had agreed, then headed back to the dinner hall to meet back up with Marlenka. From the looks of it, Marlenka had recruited one boisterous hatchling and one who looked like he’d simply rather be wrapped up in a fuzzy blanket with a cup of Cosmo’s Famous hot cocoa.

Marlenka turned to see who Audrey had brought, and her pupils shrank immediately. She pulled Audrey over to the side and whispered urgently, “Why is the purple one coming with us?”

Audrey just blinked in confusion. “I saw her all alone and it looked like she could use something fun to do. What’s the matter?”

The pair of ruby-red eyes glaring at her narrowed. “We can’t ''trust'' her, Audrey. She was born in the phantom fortress. And you remember what I said about a spy in the group?”

''The phantom fortress?'' Behind Marlenka, the purple lizard was waiting by an exit tunnel with the three others who wanted to go outside. Her face had mostly been dominated by a small frown, but when Audrey turned her head she could see what appeared to be Toxic telling her a joke and that serious and sad exterior cracking for just a moment. “How long has she been with the Defenders?”

Marlenka moved her massive shoulder again to block the view. “Two years. But I’ve been here for all three, and she hasn’t gotten any more trustworthy. Believe me.”

Audrey rested her claws lightly on Marlenka’s shoulder and moved it back down. “Then let’s use this as an opportunity to prove that she’s just like the other Defenders. There’s no valid reason we should be wary about trying to help her gain wings.”

She heard Marlenka grumble, “She could deliver her messages to the phantoms faster,” but she let Audrey walk past her and lead the way into the tunnel.

The purple lizard jumped when she saw Marlenka coming up behind her; her claws dug into the ground, her nose twitched rapidly, and she was clearly agitated by the red lizard’s presence. “Hi,” Audrey said to her as she climbed over the dirt floor. “I’m Audrey. What’s your name?”

The question clearly took the purple lizard by surprise, but when she answered there was the tiniest smile on her face. “I’m Bella.”

==Chapter Nine - Wings - Bella’s POV==
Despite Marlenka walking just a few paces behind her, Bella felt more at ease than usual as she climbed through the exit tunnel. Before, Haylee and Millie were the only lizards who had ever asked for her name. She hadn’t expected someone else, much less a newcomer like Audrey, to want her around. ''Maybe it won’t be so bad,'' Bella reasoned silently.

The ring of trees where the tunnel sloped out had been familiar to Bella for over a year. She had been content, in the first many months of being a Defender, with gathering food and leaves for the group, and some time later, with delivering messages from the Defenders to other parts of Jamaa. But then about six months ago, Marlenka had forced her to stop being a messenger or gatherer and relieved her of taking on any job duty whatsoever that involved leaving the barracks, and Bella never found out why.

It was wonderful to get a breath of the chilly natural air. For quite some time now, Bella could only leave the barracks when the Defenders were evacuating their current bunker in a phantom invasion, so to be able to enjoy the fragrance of the nearby plants and fallen leaves in peace was a welcome experience.

“Alright, guys,” Audrey said, setting the book down in the center of the clearing. “You all know how to do your elemental power thingies, right?”

Bella and the other lizards – Toxic, Cakepop, and a small green-and-tan hatchling – nodded. “Air!” Cakepop volunteered her element. Bella nodded to indicate she had the same one, picking up a fallen branch and using her breath to spin it in an infinite circle in the air.

“Marshmallow and I are both fire, right?” Toxic grinned at Marlenka. The red-and-gold lizard just glared at him and puffed a miniscule orange flame out of her mouth, accompanied by a visible cloud of breath, where it dissolved into the morning air.

Audrey stepped closer to the green hatchling. “What about you? Sorry, I haven’t learned your name yet.”

“This is Little Woo,” said Toxic. He patted the small lizard’s head. “He’s my bro!”

“Not literally, though,” Cakepop put in. “Toxic thinks everyone is his bro.”

“Well, yeah, but Panda adopted the three of us together; that’s gotta count for some extra bro points!”

The little hatchling stepped out from the pure-energy cloud occupied by Toxic and Cakepop. “My name is Wooyoung,” he said in a soft voice. He plucked a football-shaped leaf off the ground and held his claws above it like he was sprinkling dust ont0 its surface. Both Audrey and Marlenka appeared to be equally shocked as tiny spheres of water trickled from his palm onto the leaf and sat there, bright as crystals, like natural dew. “I’m… water ''and'' nature.”

It was silent for a few moments, but then Audrey walked up to him and said with a warm and genuine tone, “I think that’s really neat, buddy.”

Marlenka set her jaw. “I didn’t mean there’s something ''wrong'' with it. I think the opposite. It’s just that two elements are really rare… and really powerful.” She stepped closer to the hatchling with the eyes of a bird of prey, the same eyes that made Bella feel as insignificant as a fallen leaf deep in the woods every time they were in the same room, and paired it with a grin. “You’re gonna do some good things for the Defenders, dude.”

“Well, he’s a kid,” Audrey reasoned. Wooyoung smushed his cheek against her shoulder as she went on. “Maybe before he goes phantom-busting with the grown-ups and fights for his life in a battle, Mira forbid, we can start with trying to teach him how to fly?”

The red-and-gold lizard blinked at her with half-closed eyes, then heaved a sigh and opened up the book, leafing through pages until she could find the part about wings. “Think good thoughts,” Marlenka said loudly. “And be proud, and stuff.”

“Great,” said Toxic. He closed his eyes, trying to look peaceful, but Bella could still see his eyeball jelly rolling around in circles as if watching a Ferris wheel spin at warp speed. “I remember when Panda bought me my very own tank, custom-built to make eyes bleed… and when Little Woo got adopted and we went to the beach with him for the first time…”

“I remember that too,” said Wooyoung. He closed his eyes too, rising cautiously up onto his back legs and settling into a tree pose. “Finally getting adopted made me so happy. I miss Crystal Sands.”

Cakepop followed her friends’ lead. “Every time I’ve ever eaten a donut. Apple cider donuts! I would do anything to eat an apple cider donut right now. No joke, I’d even share it.”

“Do you want to try, Bella?” Audrey asked. Bella jumped. She had been so briefly immersed in the other lizards’ memories, imagining she was lucky enough to have a hatchlinghood like theirs.

“Oh, I… don’t really… know what I’d think about.” Bella was reluctant at first, but then she decided she didn’t want to look like she wasn’t trying in front of Audrey, who actually seemed to believe in her. So she closed her eyes and let her mind take her back to the phantom fortress.

''This isn’t a good place to start,'' she thought. But no better options came to her head before she was immersed in the setting. Bella dug through memories of the endless purple halls for anything that had the slightest chance of bringing her joy.

Dragon was the name of the only friend she grew up with. The two of them were hated equally by their parents for not being devious enough or outwardly willing to die for the phantom cause, which brought them together until it almost felt like they were siblings.

She remembered. It was freezing in the phantom fortress one night during the season that jammers called “the Jamaalidays.” Thinking no one was around, Bella stole a phantom banner off of the wall and took it back to Dragon to use as a blanket. While she was delivering it to him, a small clique of lizards caught her and told her parents what she had done.

They were furious. The blaze in their eyes was as glaring as those atop the torches bolted to the brick wall, and she was right in the center of it. Dragon heard all the noise and found her helpless, pinned beneath her parents’ narrowed eyes, and he told them that ''he'' had stolen the banner. The other lizards didn’t argue and say that he lied. As long as someone else was getting tortured for their wrongdoing, they were satisfied.

It was the first time that anyone ever stood up for her. And in the Defenders’ barracks, where every single day of her life was the polar opposite of that, she had never forgotten it.

When she opened her eyes, she was staring at her own shadow far below her, moving and flapping as if it had-

Wings.

==Chapter Ten - Help - Audrey’s POV==
Marlenka shook Audrey’s arm. “You seeing this?”

“They’re flying!” Audrey cried. All four of the lizards in front of her, though they now hovered at different heights, had grown a unique pair of wings and lifted off the ground as they were carried into the wind.

Cakepop had been first to rise, growing a tiny pair of ice-blue angel wings with two similar winglike fans on either side of her tail. “Those must be some really good donuts, Cakepop!” Marlenka shouted up at her. The pink-and-brown lizard just giggled in response and zipped over and under the treetops, whirling around branches and past leaf clusters like her whole life was made for nothing but flight.

Then it had been Toxic, whose wings resembled those of a dragon – black and webbed with yellow-green as neon as the tip of his tail. He twirled about in the breeze slower than his friend, but he still wasn’t afraid to chase her through the thickets. “Hey, Cakepop, wait up!”

“No!” Cakepop laughed, looking back at him. “You’re gonna tackle me-” She was cut off by a low tree branch that clopped her right in the throat. Though she collapsed into the grass in spot-on dead bird fashion, it took only seconds for the bottoms of her claws to be welcomed by nothing but empty space once again.

Wooyoung’s wings were beautiful. They didn’t quite resemble a typical wing shape, but they instead appeared as a blanket of clouds over the hatchling’s shoulders, rays of prismatic light radiating out from them and sparkling in the colors of a rainbow. Audrey couldn’t stop cheering him on as he got used to being in the air and letting the currents in it move him.

Then there was Bella. She seemed so concentrated, so deep in thought, with her claws tearing at the grass and her head pulled close to her shoulder blades – in a minute, though, surely enough, something began to appear on her back.

“I wonder what hers will look like,” Audrey whispered. She heard Marlenka sniff next to her, but in the corner of her eye the red lizard was indeed watching Bella lift off the ground with interest.

She rose up into the sky, the shapes on her back morphing as they flapped…

Audrey’s amethyst eyes widened as she continued to look up. At each of Bella’s sides there was a night-colored wing made of three long, squirming shapes that looked all too much like…

“Are those ''tentacles?''” Marlenka growled. Over her and Audrey’s heads, Bella opened her eyes and smiled wider than any of them had ever seen as she gazed down at her shadow and the grass beneath her.

“Audrey!” she yelped with excitement. “I… I have wings!”

Marlenka forced herself to stop staring and stomped over to ''The Secret Talents of the Lizards.'' “How does it feel to fly?” Audrey called up to her. She tried her hardest to ignore how much the wings resembled phantom appendages. It felt wrong to comment on it in general, much less when Bella was this high in the air and probably couldn’t see what they looked like.

The question made the purple lizard’s face become several shades brighter. “I wasn’t expecting it to feel like this… but Audrey, it feels amazing.” A tawny eagle soared just a pace above her head, and she took off after it as it spiraled back down to the trees.

Audrey went over to Marlenka, who had stopped at a certain point in the book and was reading a piece of it with intense interest. “It says here,” she said darkly, “that the wings’ appearance are determined by two factors: scale or eye color, and inner identity.”

“What does that mean?” Audrey asked. She figured “identity” couldn’t mean species, since only lizards could gain these wings… but what else could it refer to? “That doesn’t-”

“I don’t care about specifics,” Marlenka growled. “This is ''physical'' evidence that, in whatever way, phantoms are involved with her identity. No matter how long she stays here, the enemy is still a part of her.”

Audrey tried to make it all make sense in her head. “But you said she’s been a Defender for ''two'' years. She can’t be aligned with the phantoms still; she’s been fighting for the Defenders’ cause for longer than most, right?”

“Hardly. She’s not allowed to be a gatherer ever since I realized there was a spy situation going on… but I guess she’s still managed to find a way to tell the phantoms where we are somehow. I’ve tried, but I haven’t been able to pinpoint her method.”

No matter what she said, Audrey couldn’t comprehend it any easier. “If you’re so convinced she’s the spy… why is she still here?”

Marlenka checked to make sure the other lizards were still occupied with learning to use their wings. “Because ''Haylee''has to have the final say, and she thinks if we can’t catch her in the act, we can’t get rid of her.” She swiped at a patch of dirt with her claws, revealing a maze of frost tendrils woven into the frozen soil underneath. “So now we constantly have to deal with being vulnerable and never being able to stay in one space for long.”

It took Audrey by surprise when Bella landed near her side, away from Marlenka. The purple lizard’s eyes were wide and filled with horror, and she had shrunken back to the same tense, twitchy version of herself that Audrey had seen before she left her memory.

“Audrey,” Bella whispered. She stared down at her own shadow. “My wings. I- I don’t know what they-”

Audrey felt a thump on her back: Marlenka’s tail. The muscular lizard swore. “Wooyoung! Cakepop! Get back in the barracks, ''right'' now!”

In a bush above where the others were gliding around, a proto-phantom floated up and down, its single eye unblinking as it stared at the armadillo lizards. Audrey jolted when she saw it. It looked just like the one that had stopped Loafie from fleeing the phantom raid. Then what must have been a dozen more rose up from either side of it. Seeing how similar all of the proto-phantoms looked to one another made a chill creep down her spine.

“What’d you say?” shouted Cakepop, who was still doing loops in the wind. A slimy purple web shot out of the earth and reached for her tail, just barely missing her before splatting back in the grass and pushing the green blades into the dirt.

Wooyoung had heard Marlenka’s warning and landed, Toxic at his tail, behind Audrey. “Go back into the bunker and call for a code purple,” Marlenka snarled at her and Toxic. She swore again. “We haven’t even been here a month.”

If she said more, Audrey didn’t hear it. Toxic raced ahead of her with a practiced determination, zooming into the dinner hall as if he still had wings, and Audrey came up behind him as quickly as she could. “CODE PURPLE!” he yelled.

No one in the hall seemed terribly surprised, but they did begin hurrying for their hatchlings and the possessions they could carry. A group of lizards shot forward and escaped through the entrance tunnel – presumably messengers or scouts, since Audrey recognized Kaylee among the mix – as if they had been waiting for this moment.

Haylee was there in no time. “Oh no,” she muttered. “This is the worst time to have to evacuate. It’s so cold out now.” But she didn’t complain for long. She went up to Toxic and told him, “My chart says that there are four lizards out gathering and one messenger is supposed to be heading home from a phantom resistance summit.

“The scouts just left to get the gatherers-” Haylee turned to Audrey. “Halo’s with them, but don’t worry, he’s in good claws with Vatra. They should be a little ways away from here, and the scouts are going to let them know we need to leave. Eira,” she continued, stopping a pale-purple lizard who was walking by, “can you head in the direction of Mt. Shiveer? We’ll be heading for the north Jamaa Township bunker, so go there when you’ve found Misty.” Facing Audrey again, she explained, “We haven’t been to that one in about a year, and both here and there are around the same distance to the spot where we need to raid Mt. Shiveer tomorrow.”

“Do you need me for anything?” Audrey asked once Toxic followed the scouts out of the entrance tunnel. A crowd of lizards were filing out swiftly behind him. Some of their faces looked alarmed, but their claws moved in an understanding and accepting kind of way that hurt Audrey’s heart.

Haylee scribbled something on the whiteboard and shook her head without looking at Audrey. “Make sure you’re calm when you leave just in case of a panic. You’ll be okay.”

The purple-and-silver lizard shifted on her claws. “Are you sure there’s no way I can help out?”

Finally Haylee glanced at her over her shoulder before turning back. “Stay with the hatchlings and make sure they’re calm.” Audrey nodded and poked into the entrances to sleeping caverns to look for hatchlings. Before she left, she heard Haylee murmur through gritted teeth, “We don’t have time to grab the blankets…”

==Chapter Eleven - Friend - Halo’s POV==
It was awkward once Haylee sent Halo and Vatra on their way to gather leaves. The unfamiliar orange lizard smiled at him every now and then when he was glancing her way to take in the local trees’ final moments of golden beauty for the year, but she didn’t seem very talkative.

Halo decided he would be the one to start the conversation. “So… how do you find leaves that don’t go away in the winter?”

“The gatherers go to south Sarepia Forest together in the middle of fall to grab some leaves, since the leaves don’t fall as quickly there and our bunker is usually close enough,” Vatra replied. Her reminiscent expression turned wistful. “We were in the Lost Temple of Zios bunker getting a good bunch of them, and then the next day we had to move out. That’s why we don’t have a stock here.”

“I guess you’ll find their carcasses the next time you go to that bunker,” Halo joked.

Vatra chuckled awkwardly. “Haha, yeah.”

It was silent for the next few minutes. Then Vatra stopped at a clump of bushes. “Boxwood,” she said. “The leaves are small, but the branches are nice to have because the bark makes for good seasoning. And I see some wintercreepers over there that we can grab.”

While she brought some of the wintercreeper tendrils over and stuffed them in a straw sack, Halo got to work picking off the boxwood branches. Side by side, the leaves didn’t look any different from one another, except the wintercreepers were tinged with yellow at the edges.

“You sure know a lot about these,” Halo remarked.

Vatra, who still appeared mildly embarrassed, gave him a toothy smile. “I’ve been a gatherer for as long as I’ve been a Defender. It’s fun bringing back things and seeing what the cooks make with it.”

She dipped her snout into her sack, low enough that the smell of the wintercreepers flooded her nose, which just brushed the yellow-dappled leaves. “If we hurry back… maybe it won’t be too late to bring the boxwood to the cooks so they can use it in a stew for lunch!”

“What does it taste like?” Halo sniffed at the bagged-up wintercreepers, then took a whiff of his boxwood pile. Neither plant’s leaves had a particularly pungent scent, but the faint aroma of evergreens – like one of the scented candles Loafie would burn back in her den – blanketed their surface.

“Like winter on the way.”

Halo’s own pouch, which Loafie had given to him full of fruit and bread that had been emptied out by his nest before the gathering trip, was more than full by the time the lizards planned to head back. “Wow, this thing sure is itchy,” he commented.

That made Vatra laugh in a way that sounded less forced. “Boy, don’t I know it. We shouldn’t be far from the barracks, though. Ten minutes if we walk back on the same path we came.”

Halo slowly turned his head toward her. “How many minutes if we run?”

Crinkled leaves of all the warm colors flashed beneath the two lizards’ claws, rearing up like wave crests in their wake. Halo hadn’t run this fast in… well, ever. His days used to be spent lounging around in his round fluffy bed, wrestling with Audrey in the yard, and following Loafie to trading spots on occasion. He had never felt like he ''could'' run so far, so fast.

Haylee had given Halo and Vatra each a blanket to keep warm before she sent them off to gather, and both lizards had chosen to wear them to keep them within reach – regrettable move, Halo decided as he and Vatra coursed after one another through the winding woods, although there weren’t many alternatives. The white and brown fuzz flapped against their scales as they pushed on, so buffeted by the wind that they looked made of dandelion seeds, like they could just blow away and be gone at any moment.

Halo stopped first. He was too big and pampered to keep up with a lizard who’d been living in the outside world for what he assumed was a while. The roots of a tree with three red leaves just barely clinging to its branches was his place of choice to flop down. Vatra saw him submit to his empty lungs and fell over on her side a few paces away.

“Wow,” she said, almost completely out of breath. “We’re… gonna be in… oxygen debt for… the rest of our lives.” Her eyes widened like something had stabbed her and she sat back in a leaf pile, clutching her hind legs. “Geez! Lactic acid is ''not'' fun.”

Halo kept panting. “I don’t know what that is, but if I could sell it, I bet I’d make enough to afford a white bowtie.”

The orange forest, he thought, made a great place to rest. Every now and then a chilly breeze would float over his and Vatra’s heads and swipe from the trees the leaves that had been hanging on for dear life. Halo pictured taking Audrey with him to this spot so that they could gather some leaves or bush branches or something and weave a hammock between the trees. They would start working at dawn and then, when a day of work was done, lay in it side by side and watch the sun roll down through the arms of the branches.

''She wouldn’t do that anyway,'' Halo thought, glowering at nothing in particular. ''She’s all occupied with her new friends. Why would she ever want to hang out with me when all these intriguing wild lizards are falling into her claws?''

He bet she’d be hanging out with Toxic. ''He thinks he’s so funny. Cannonball into the tunnel… pshh. Find something more impressive to fail at doing.''

Someone appeared around the corner that made both Halo and Vatra jump. Halo thought at first that thinking about Toxic had magically conjured the annoying highlighter-faced lizard into the scene, but who he saw instead was Kaylee, the scout who had said she watched Loafie get captured.

But just as Halo’s brain was starting to pick at all the copious aspects of her personality he so despised, he took notice of the solemn look on her face. She answered his and Vatra’s visible confusion by saying “code purple” in as loud a voice as Halo had ever heard her use, though it wasn’t as if she often spoke within his range of hearing at all.

“Haylee wants you to know we’re going to the north Jamaa Township bunker. They’re giving chase. Rendezvous by the fallen log.” Then she spun back around and darted away through the trees.

“Code purple?” Halo echoed. “Chase? What’s going on, Vatra?”

Vatra bit her lip and pulled her brown blanket over her shoulders. “The phantoms found where we were hiding; that’s what the code purple means. And it sounds like they’re chasing us out, so… there’s probably gonna be a battle. Now we need to leave for Jamaa Township so we can get into ''those'' barracks…”

Halo was silent with shock. “We just… leave?”

“That’s what we have to do when this happens.”

“Where’s this fallen log? Are we splitting up or sticking together? The Defenders, I mean.”

“We’ll all be together, since the phantoms don’t have the mental capacity to split up, so we’d lose the numbers if we go off in groups.” Vatra swished her tail over a patch of fallen leaves to signal he should follow her. “The fallen log isn’t far from here; it’s a spot the gatherers go for moss, so I know the way.”

It didn’t look like any phantoms were coming after them yet. But the back of his eyelids always seemed to be playing the memory of Loafie’s capture, and Halo decided he’d rather be safe than sorry. As soon as Vatra finished speaking, he adjusted his snow-colored blanket, secured the pouch over his shoulder, and followed her deeper into the woods.

==Chapter Twelve - Battle - Audrey’s POV==
At least six hatchlings were sticking close to Audrey as she led the way out of the exit tunnel and into the open woods. Some of the Defenders had already gone ahead and created rows to fend off the phantoms that descended on the group.

“Will we be okay?” one of the hatchlings asked. Audrey recognized him from earlier; he was one of the lizards who had been teasing Halo. “I only joined two weeks ago… I don’t know what happens when we have to move.”

“We will,” Audrey reassured him. “Look up there. See all those phantoms getting busted? Everyone’s working so hard to protect us.”

Cakepop nodded. “They’re super good. Look!” She pointed up ahead, where Toxic hefted a boomseed in one claw, tossed it into the air, and blasted it forward with a burst of his elemental fire, causing it to explode in a row of shocked phantoms’ faces. Audrey winced as one got hit directly in its wide-open eye in the last moment of its life.

While Marlenka directed attacks on the phantoms, Haylee was guiding the others further into the forest. The array of fighting lizards made strategic shifts to keep the rest of the group covered, never letting up with the explosive action. Lizards at the tail end of the mob dug up stores of boomseeds buried under tree roots and tossed them to their comrades while the rest pressed forward.

Audrey had found the Defenders’ elemental powers astounding during the brief training session when they showed off a tiny fraction of their skills, but watching the whole group use them to work together was something else. The orange-and-gold forest was ripped with red and blue and green and all the colors of paint dripping off some of the projectile boomseeds as the Defenders fought back against the shadow-colored monsters invading their home.

The hatchlings kept ducking underneath Audrey’s claws as she tried to walk; it didn’t help that occasional splatters of phantom goop landed a little too close to them as they tried to escape. “Get on my back, Wooyoung,” she told the hatchling, who she guessed was the smallest of those who kept close to her. “Cakepop, you look like you might fit too-”

Out of nowhere, Halo burst through the woods beyond the clearing, swinging his head around wildly until he locked eyes with Audrey. “Halo!” she yelled. “Over here!”

“I’m tired,” one of the hatchlings complained.

“I’m cold,” said another.

“I’m scared!” yelped a third. “I don’t know where my mommy is.”

Audrey let her tail drag over the ground so that Cakepop could scramble up onto her back beside Wooyoung, who quivered as he clung to her purple-and-silver scales. Two small lizards alone were quite a weight for her spine to handle, but as long as they stayed there comfortably, she traversed the crowd without so much as a grumble. “Don’t worry. The phantoms are going to go away really soon, and then we can rest for a long time. How about you take turns on my back?”

“I can carry some of them,” Halo offered. He bent his head back to grab the white blanket on his shoulders between his teeth, then swung back around and flopped it on Audrey’s back. “C’mere, kids. I’ll carry you up. Woof, you’re heavy!”

On Audrey’s back, both Cakepop and Wooyoung rolled underneath the blanket before it even hit her shoulders. The fuzzy material insulated her well from the bite of impending winter that was making several Defenders up ahead shiver as they went by. “Thank you, Halo,” she said with a smile.

Halo blushed. “Uhh, yeah, well, you’re welcome.” Audrey didn’t see him awkwardly grin back before she turned to her side and guided a straying hatchling closer to her with her tail.

A few minutes later, the moving battle still raged as hard as ever. Somewhere in the distance, too far away for Audrey to see, Big Bird showed off his remarkable vocal range while he cheered on Toxic’s boomseed-bomb chucks. In the corner of her eye, Audrey saw Halo, decked out with several new hatchling back accessories, keep changing his walking speed like he was trying to avoid stepping in time with the dissonant screams of the solid-yellow lizard at all costs.

Phantom goop, purple and bubbly and super gross, now littered the path where the Defenders were traveling. Big Bird screeched an electric riff as another flaming boomseed connected with a heavy phantom. “It sure is starting to look like a poison paradise,” Audrey commented when she glanced back at the damage that had been done so far.

Some lengths away, pastel scales moved against the direction of the Defenders’ mob. Audrey watched the shape move side to side trying to get through before giving up, stepping off to the side, and waiting for Audrey to reach the giant leafless oak tree where she stood.

“How’s it going?” Haylee asked her once they had caught up to one another, once again walking with the crowd’s flow. “Is everyone good?”

Audrey turned around to look at the hatchlings. “You all doing okay?”

She was answered by a chorus of squeaks from the mini-mob of lizards that kept between her and Halo. “I’m okay,” one of them said. “Can I have a turn on your back, please?”

Wooyoung slid off Audrey’s back and tumbled onto the ground unhurt. “Oh, thanks, Woo!” Audrey said to him. “Sure, Duke. Come up by my shoulder.”

Haylee seemed amazed by how well the hatchlings were behaving. “Wow, you’re really good with them! And you too, Halo, glad you got back here safely! I hate to ask you another favor, but would you mind taking them closer to the front? There are a few more hatchlings there with their worried parents, and also fewer phantoms.”

“You don’t mind if we pick up the pace a little bit, do you, guys?” Audrey asked the hatchlings. “Haylee wants us up at the front where some of your friends and parents probably are.”

“Sprite!” Cakepop exclaimed. “We need to go find Sprite and Ace!”

As her friends whooped in support, Audrey said, “I think that means they’re cool with it.”

Haylee bobbed her head on her neck. “I’ll let you lead the way. The rest of us have got a raid to finish off.”

==Chapter Thirteen - Mira - Audrey’s POV==
“Aim for the proto-phantoms!” Marlenka shouted at the Defenders. “They’re the ones that move- ''fastest!''” From her arm, which was drawn back nearly as far as her tail’s tip, she slung a boomseed slobbered with red paint at a row of proto-phantoms that had tried to circle around to the front of the group. Several of them morphed into murky purple shapes and then disappeared in the colorful explosion that followed.

Toxic bounded up beside her. “Hey, Margarita! Wanna double your blazepower there?”

The red-and-gold lizard grimaced at him. “Eugh, fine.” She lifted her claws to the air as fire began to swirl around her wrist, and Toxic did the same. “Make sure not to hit any trees, bullseye.”

“Don’t you worry, Mar!” When Toxic opened his claws, a ray of fire shot out of both his and Marlenka’s palms and evaporated the nearest phantoms on contact.

From up in the treetops, a voice like sandpaper screamed down, “Now! Get ‘em!” Half-hidden among the leaves was the shape of a large phantom wearing a helmet that looked to be made of melted and reshaped purple clay. When he lifted his tentacle forward, a rain of dark phantom goop splattered down into the grass and landed in giant puddles.

“Look out ahead!” Haylee cried out with alarm when she saw what was happening. Over by Audrey, Cakepop had stopped moving to admire the downpour as a huge glob of it fell rapidly down towards her face. “Sparkly,” she whispered.

Without thinking to speak, Audrey whirled around on her claws and hauled the smaller lizard forward in the air to keep her scales from burning against the grass. The goop landed on a tree that Cakepop had stood in front of moments ago, smashing into it hard enough that the bark above the roots was left cracked or dented.

“You okay?” Audrey asked her shakily.

Cakepop wailed. “I’m sorry! I just wanted to look at it. It was so glittery… like… glitter…”

Before Audrey could reassure her, Halo’s scream rang out across the flattened blades of green. A higher cry of pain followed right behind his own. “Halo!” she yelped. She saw two dark-purple globs land on a flash of teal and orange, but she couldn’t be sure it was Halo. It was impossible to see where he was in the mass of lizards moving across the ground and tossing their boomseeds and elemental magic into the floating ranks of the phantoms. ''And I can’t leave these hatchlings here, in all this turmoil, just to check if he’s okay. But then who will?''

A huge round phantom burst through the lizard crowd and rolled her way, bristling with tentacles that looked to be the size of baseballs. Before it could get close enough for Audrey to smell its awful reek, a pair of orange beams melted it on the spot. She flinched and watched it jump with surprise as it got hit by the beam, its spherical tentacles rolling in circles down the pile of gray sludge that used to be its body. When it dropped to the ground, Audrey saw Marlenka and Toxic side by side with their claws outstretched. “You good, Purple?” Marlenka asked her. She blew once on her claws and a wave of thin steam hissed off them.

Audrey nodded. But she knew she couldn’t keep up all these close calls for long. The hatchlings needed real protection, not a series of lucky saves. ''Where’s Haylee?'' she wondered, but the pastel lizard was nowhere to be seen. ''Hopefully that just means she’s gotten the group further ahead.''

At last, she came up with an idea. ''There are no phantoms in the trees on'' this ''side of the path…'' “Everyone,” she said, bending her head low so that the younger lizards knew she was talking to them, “I have a plan, but it’s gonna take a lot of effort. I need you all to close your eyes and keep walking, and think happy thoughts. Think about all the things you can’t wait to do when we get to our new home. If everything goes right… then you guys will get wings, and we can fly up to the giant evergreen up there to hide, okay?”

“I can show you how!” Cakepop offered to her friends. She bumped tails with Wooyoung, who was so small it nearly knocked him on his side. “So can Little Woo. C’mon!”

Audrey dropped back behind the hatchlings to ensure they kept moving and didn’t stray away from the group while their eyes were shut. Cakepop was first again to gain her wings, ice-blue and dazzling with iridescence, and Wooyoung got his own half a minute later, followed by a few other hatchlings.

But not everybody was having luck. “It’s not working,” one of them told Audrey, opening his eyes and stomping on in frustration.

“Yeah, I’m too scared,” another one agreed. “I can’t do it.”

For a moment Audrey considered whether she should just persuade them to keep trying, but the phantoms were still holding their own, and she couldn’t risk an accident. “Alright, Cakepop, Wooyoung, lead all the lizards that can fly up to that evergreen, and once you get there, ''hide''. Can you do that?”

Wooyoung nodded again. “Sure, Audrey.” He swept his tail and shot forward with the others behind, his rainbow wings not out of place in the forest scene among the colorful mix of elemental powers being used by the older Defenders.

With the winged hatchlings gone, Audrey was left with three who still struggled to gain them. “Just stay calm and keep your eyes open,” she soothed them. “I’m going to carry you to the tree myself, okay?”

They clustered closer to her legs again, but she didn’t mind. She closed her eyes and tried to think of good times. Trips with Loafie to Crystal Sands every summer. Meeting Halo when Loafie adopted him and brought him home for the first time. Looking at the empty vial – the one that Audrey herself had hatched from – that Loafie kept on display atop the hearth in her den, because she was that proud to be Audrey’s hatcher and forever owner.

Toxic telling her about the snow coming to Sarepia Forest. Getting cheered on as she volunteered for the Mt. Shiveer mission. Watching the others get their wings for the first time.

There was no way to tell when she and Halo would get Loafie back. Audrey bit her lip to battle tears at all the possibilities of horrible conditions Loafie could be living under while captive in the phantoms’ fortress.

But even though her eyes were closed, she saw the Defenders. Blazes rushed past and made the backs of her eyelids glow for a split second. She heard the sounds of water spraying outward and plants pushing through the earth, and felt the wind as it looped around her ears. If anyone could bring back Loafie, it was them.

Something pushed out from behind Audrey’s arms and kept growing. When she opened her eyes, a feathery silver wing rested at each of her sides, immaculate and practically sparkling. There was no time to admire them before she gestured for the hatchlings to clamber onto her back and took off for the evergreen, but while she lifted into the air on birdlike wings she couldn’t help but think of Mira, the goddess of Jamaa. She looked down and gasped so deeply that she struggled to keep her balance for a moment.

Audrey would have been less surprised to see the shimmering blue heron, the Sky Mother, land in the midst of the battle if the world had suddenly gone dark and lightning struck her out of the sky.

==Chapter Fourteen - Scarf - Audrey’s POV==
The indescribable shock at watching Mira’s wings float to the forest floor was only made more heart-smacking when the heron goddess craned her neck up at the evergreen tree and stared directly at Audrey, who couldn’t stop staring at her twinkling blue figure. The lizard decided in her mind that falling out of the tree and landing on her skull would have been a better reaction to Mira’s arrival at the scene of the battle.

Phantoms scattered instantly at Mira’s landing. She hardly glanced at them as they fled in fright, some of the smaller ones spontaneously bursting at the mere sight of her. “Retreat! ''Retreat!''” ordered the helmeted phantom. He didn’t so much as look back once as he led his troops away.

The forest, despite all the lizards standing in it while frozen in a variety of fighting poses, was as still as an empty lake. Nearly a hundred pairs of Defenders’ eyes were locked on the shape of the giant bird. At her side, a golden-brown mask with teal gemstone eyes and an intricate face glimmered into existence from nothing but the air.

“Greetings, Defenders of Jamaa.” Mira’s beak didn’t move when she spoke, but when she turned again to set her eyes on the evergreen tree and arched her long neck, Audrey realized the goddess was gesturing for her to come forward.

Awkwardly, the purple-and-silver lizard hugged the top of the trunk where she had been clinging and shifted her way over the needles until she felt something pulling her off the tree. At first Audrey tried to hang on, but then she saw the hatchlings being lifted into the breeze as well, surrounded by clouds of blue, and she let the magic carry her downwards. When her claws touched down on the ground again and her wings disappeared, she was beside Marlenka and the hatchlings were with their friends or parents.

“Zios and I commend you all for your selflessness and willingness to engage in teamwork as you always have,” Mira continued. Zios just floated next to her. Audrey thought that he looked a little out-of-place there, with his smaller form and unchanging expression, while Mira’s eyes marbled a new color every half a second and were constantly filled with worry.

The heron swept her wings across the grass, and although it passed through them like an apparition’s limb, all of the phantom goop splattered across it rose up off the ground and disappeared. “The already-dire situation that you all work so hard to fight every day has reached a new level of danger. Seven days ago, the alphas were captured and imprisoned in the phantom fortress. Each of them has volunteered to give up their powers until they are free and in a state to fight once again.”

Her opalline eyes rested on a sorrowful blue. “As Zios and I are restricted from any ability to infiltrate the fortress ourselves, since our capabilities to affect the physical world now are limited, all that we can do for the time being is grant their wish. The alphas no longer possess their magic – but they have requested that six new animals take their place.”

Silence still remained. Not a soul had spoken ever since her talons touched down in the woods.

“And so we looked upon none other than the Defenders of Jamaa, protectors of the land on their own volition, and valued members of the community that continue to keep Jamaa safe in its darkest hours.” Mira’s head turned back toward Audrey and Marlenka, who were next to one another. Audrey could’ve sworn that big, tough, scary Marlenka had been leaning toward her and quivering up until she saw the goddess’s eyes on her.

“Marlenka. Long have you not only fought alongside, but ''commanded'' your fellow Defenders with a fierce vigor unmatched by even the bravest of Jamaa’s warriors. And that rings just as true today as it has for the last three years of your life. Your effect on the fighters I stand before is no less than that of the sun on the springtime forest.”

Turning to Audrey, she went on. “And Audrey. You have only recently faced more discomfort and peril than you have in the entire rest of your life combined, and yet you have faced it head-on with the energy of an adventurous mother – one who never wants to stop aiding friends in need or protecting those who cannot protect themselves.”

Mira’s bent neck straightened again and her eyes glowed brighter than before. “We grant to you two the powers and titles of sun alpha and moon alpha respectively. Use them for no more than the time permits, and no less than the defense of the land you love. I trust that you, among four other Defenders who Zios and I have yet to select for the remaining positions, will use them on behalf of the forces of good while you possess them still.”

She lifted her wings and began to rise in the air beside Zios’s floating, unchanged face. “Never give up, loyal Defenders of Jamaa. This fight is far from over yet.” And then her feathers blended back into the daylight, which had fully broken, and both she and her companion were gone.

Audrey looked at Marlenka. The white shape of a sun, which definitely hadn’t been there before, glowed on the red lizard’s forehead. “You got a little… something,” Marlenka muttered, staring intensely between Audrey’s own temples, where a crescent shape had appeared with Mira’s disappearance.

When she looked down at herself, Audrey saw that there was a scarf wrapped around her neck, waving upwards as if it were reaching toward the faded goddess. It resembled the same color as her facial scales, but it was woven with silvery threads like spider silk that twinkled with light when she moved. ''A gift from Mira. I’m… the moon alpha.''

The first thing that Audrey did after receiving her new title was faint.

==Chapter Fifteen - Mission - Dragon’s POV==
All was dark and silent in the prison. Dragon and Skip, on the orders of their boss Julie, threw rotting scraps to the imprisoned alphas and then slammed the doors behind them. Dragon hated the way the chief alpha looked at him like he was a lost puppy. He was a lizard, born in the phantom fortress, and nothing about his hard exterior made him look any less.

He stopped to glance out the tiny arched window as he was proceeding down the stairs and back to the throne room. Tiny as fireflies in the distance, a row of fire drums erupted with flame. A few seconds later, the next row lit up as well.

Skip seemed to have noticed too. The purple-and-gold lizard skittered down the stairs from a higher cell and met back up with Dragon at the window. “Ey, you see all’at??” He pointed out towards the shadowed shapes that marched toward the fortress. “The Gen’ral’s back!”

Before Dragon could take another step, Skip shoved him toward the window and took off down the rest of the stairs. It would have been too small for Dragon to have fit through anyway, but the sight of the ground so far below him still made his head spin briefly. Glaring after the other lizard’s tail, he raced down the spiral after him.

By the time Skip and Dragon reached the bottom of the stairs and entered the high-roofed, sordid throne room – qualifying as that solely because it had a throne, if even a rocky one that seemed to be carved directly from a chunk of a mountain – the phantom army ranks were almost finished filing into it. Its size was noticeably smaller, although it was still led by the same helmeted commander with seven tentacles and an eye that managed to look determined and nervous at the same time.

The shape of the king, which in the lack of light seemed completely melded with the rugged throne, leaned forward ever so slightly. He was well aware of the shrink; Dragon could see it in his huge narrowed eye. But he was waiting for the general to speak first.

“Your majesty,” said the general, bowing so low to the floor that his eye might have been laying flat on it.

There he stayed for any number of moments, face planted in the floor and uneven number of arms splayed out in a display of respect for his king. Then the king spoke, with a voice so deep yet so even that Dragon found it astounding he sat on such a craggy surface all day: “''Explain'', Lido''.''”

General Lido plucked himself up off the floor and adjusted his helmet. “Yes, my king. We found the sniveling lizards in the middle of Sarepia Forest, and they seemed to flee for northeastern Jamaa Township. The capture of their leader was unsuccessful, however we have surely managed to deplete much of their… weapon storage, and now they’re not able to replenish it, for we have behind bars the alphas who supplied them with such materials.”

The king didn’t blink. “Surely.”

“Surely,” General Lido repeated. Then his eye widened as he realized his mistake.

“Did you complete ''no'' objectives that were given to you?” The king scraped one tentacle up the arm of his throne. “This was not a weapons depletion mission. And whatever you would like to believe you ''surely'' might have depleted…”

His gaze stopped wandering across the army that stood before him and fixed, with the intensity of a knife whose blade was level as the tone of his voice, on the general. “Have they not depleted your army beyond the accomplishment of your own ends?”

The general stayed silent for a short while. Dragon winced at what he was watching. Keeping quiet was the worst choice Lido could have made… but then the phantom seemed to reach the same conclusion and spoke again.

“It was the heron, your majesty,” he continued. “She descended from the sky and turned half our forces to mush just by looking at her-”

“Oh, no, Lido. This army is ''yours.'' I did not raise them day and night for months to be so weak as to evaporate at the sight of a bird.”

General Lido looked away in embarrassment. ''How did he ever get a rank in the phantom army at all?'' Dragon wondered. “Majesty, this is the first time any of us have ever seen her in our lives,” the general went on. He turned his head toward the phantoms who floated in rows behind him like he was looking for confirmation. Not one of them said a word.

“This is a disappointment beyond all past disappointments,” growled the king. “Have you truly accomplished nothing in terms of prisoners or other goals that were asked of you?”

General Lido looked like he wished he’d just spontaneously busted at the sight of Mira hours ago. “Well, your majesty… some of the phantoms you see before you had been experimenting with a special type of goop before leaving for the quest. We had taken a prototype along with us to test it on the pathetic lizards.” He swiveled to face his army again. “What were the successes?”

It took a few beats for one heavy phantom to reluctantly reply. “We counted three confirmed hits,” it said. “Now we just need to return to the labs and check whether it… I mean, how well it’s working.”

“Oh, yes. I remember you mentioning something about a little project for the lizards. What was the purpose of this research again?” asked the phantom king.

“We think that any lizards hit by it will slowly succumb to such a state that we’re able to control their minds at any time and see into their surroundings.” The general frowned. “Not to be impertinent, my king, but we would be able to be more certain that the goop works if you had allowed us to test it on the spy who lives among the Defenders.”

The king raised his tentacle. “You may not use our spy for any assessment reasons whatsoever. She offered her services to us of her own free will, and I refuse to let your ill-tested experiments affect that if it should go awry. It was because of ''her'' information that you were able to go on your mission at all… so another disservice to her is not necessary.”

“Of course, sir; we have no need for her in that way anymore. Now that we’ve landed the goop on at least a few of the lizards, we will be able to monitor how well their minds let us in over the next few weeks.”

Although the king had no mouth, Dragon could swear he smiled at these words. “Yes, indeed you will. Evidently you are not structured for the battlefield, so I encourage you to find your true use in the labs and ensure that your prototype works.”

General Lido twitched with shock. “Your majesty? The labs? But- but I’ve led the last four raids on the lizards’ camps. Who else can be- can be trusted with the duty to continue hunting them down?”

“Why, Julie seems very eager to prove her skills. Don’t you, Julie?”

A purple phantom emerged from the shadows on the wall. Dragon kept himself from flinching; he hadn’t even known she was there. She stood out among the ranks of the army for being lighter in color than almost all of them – instead of being white with a black pupil like the others, Julie’s eye was a dazzling light purple. All of the phantoms’ stares were fixed on her as she smirked and floated up to the side of the king’s throne.

“You called, your majesty.” She said it like a statement, looking at him through a half-closed eye.

The king’s eye remained fixed on General Lido. “I understand that you have worked very hard training your students.”

“Very true.” She blinked her single eye at Lido in such a way that it looked like she was winking. He narrowed his eye at her with annoyance, but then remembered that the king was watching him and quit looking her way. “They’re the hardest-working young phantoms in the fortress. Some would even say their skills outdo those of some of our ''army'' fighters.”

Dragon watched Lido as his tentacles quivered with silent rage. Julie hated him more than anything, especially because he was the king’s right hand (tentacle?) instead of her. She saw him as completely useless and never missed an opportunity to stomp on his failings in front of the king.

Personally, Dragon found it difficult to spit on his name that hard, since he just seemed to be trying his hardest and acting with the phantoms’ best interests at heart, and Julie making him constantly compete for the king’s praise and attention couldn’t have made any of that easier. But he would never say that to her. The last thing he wanted was to be on the wrong side of her aspirations to supplant Lido and exterminate his supporters.

“I’d be no less than honored to capture the lizards’ leader and any other sorry reptiles who stumble into my path.” Julie signaled toward the wall she had emerged from, and Skip, followed by Dragon, scampered up to her. “All I need beside me are my trusty scalebound wingmen.”

The king’s pupil moved in her direction. “It would be a very impressive feat if the three of you alone could bring the lizard leader back here. You would earn no small reward for serving the phantom cause in such a way, and I am willing to guarantee you a major role in her torture. But if you fail as Lido did…”

Julie gave him a dark grin. “Oh, you don’t even need to worry about that.” She patted Skip and Dragon’s heads once with her tentacle. “I can’t wait to surprise you at how much easier it is for ''lizards'' to make a more effective accompaniment than an entire army.” She cast a wicked smile in the direction of the glaring Lido. “You won’t see us return until I’ve got the leader’s neck in my grasp.”

==Chapter Sixteen - Awake - Audrey’s POV==
When Audrey came to her senses and the darkness cleared from her eyes she was wrapped up like a baby in the white blanket that Halo had been wearing. Halo himself was there too, a short distance away, alongside Marlenka – who still had, although it wasn’t glowing, the white sun mark on her forehead. ''So I'' didn’t ''imagine all that.''

“Wakey wakey, chocolate shakey.” Marlenka walked up to her and prodded her shoulder. “Woo, it’s been like three days of walking and stopping and walking and stopping and urghhhh. Now that you’re not on the verge of death, someone else could probably use that blanket. Did you know we only were able to bring like seven of them for almost a hundred lizards?”

Audrey rolled out of the blanket and instantly winced at how hard the temperature bit down on her scales. There were much fewer trees now to shield anyone from the cold, and not very far was a stretch of buildings followed by arctic land that seemed to be the northern edge of Jamaa Township. It looked like the others were having plenty of their own trouble, too; not too far away they had formed a few reptilian cuddle piles as they tried to keep shelter under the leafless trees.

“Here you go,” said Audrey, handing over the blanket, unable to hide the chattering of her teeth. She rubbed the spot on her forehead where her moon-shaped alpha mark had appeared, but it didn’t even feel like anything was there. “Geez, how’d I even get here?”

Marlenka took it from her and tossed it to Halo, who then gave it to one of the huddling lizards. “I mean, you passed out, so ''obviously-''” she clicked and curled her tail over her back. “-someone had to carry you there. Like a big strong donkey, I was.”

The other lizard just blinked at her. “Big strong donkey.”

“Yeah, you get it. We’ll probably only be allowed to take one blanket for the Mt. Shiveer mission next week because there’s not many of us going, which will suck, so maybe you can repay the favor and give me a little piggyback action, huh, huh?”

“Oh, shoot, the mission.” Audrey stretched out and surveyed the land around her. The shapes of buildings were faintly visible in the distance; she guessed that Haylee had had them break the journey to the Jamaa Township bunker into two parts. She was just glad it wasn’t more. ''Once we’re on the move again I’ll probably warm up a bit,'' she figured.

Halo came back and sniffed her head. “You okay? Your… thingy’s still there.”

“Oh, good,” Marlenka put in. She gathered her weight and began walking over toward Haylee, who was across the way. “I was afraid it fell off while I made my daring escapade.”

It felt no different for Audrey now that she had the mark on her forehead. ''Should it feel different?'' she wondered. If Mira had really transferred the moon alpha power to her… what was it supposed to mean? Was there supposed to be magic coursing through her bloodstream or something? Would the moon explode if she ever whipped out a primal battle yell?

But something disturbed her even more than not knowing what she was supposed to do, now that she maybe had extra abilities that she still wasn’t aware of. Back in the Sarepia Forest bunker, all the way down in the storage room, she had flipped through ''Secret Talents of the Lizards'' and recalled finding a table in the chapter about magic types. Up until now, Liza had been the moon alpha.

Liza, the ''chief'' of the alphas.

“Do you need me to get you anything?” Halo asked. “You look a little feverish.”

Audrey felt her own head, but it wasn’t warm. It was freezing, actually. She drew back her claws almost the second they made contact with her face. “I’m good. But… thank you. Could you do me one favor, though?”

“Uh, yeah, anything,” Halo replied, his cheeks a little rosy.

“Could you ask Haylee if she could get her book? Make sure she’s not busy, though. I still feel a little dizzy when I try to walk, so I’ll be sitting by that tree for a while. It looks pretty sheltered.” She knew that Marlenka took the book with her when the Defenders left the barracks, since it had already been outside when the lizards trained, but she also knew Marlenka had had a lot of commanding to do in the moments that followed, and Haylee didn’t have it when she checked in on Audrey and the hatchlings, so the book could have been passed off to anyone.

Halo tilted his head at her. “What book? They had books in there?”

''Whoops.'' Audrey hadn’t even thought about Halo questioning the book. She still didn’t know whether she was supposed to even mention it yet to anyone except the lizards who had already gotten their wings. “Haylee will know what to do if you ask her, don’t worry.”

Her response made Halo’s red x-eyes squint a little bit with hurt. “Is it a secret or something?”

Audrey rested her claws over his own. “Not really, Halo, it’s just something we were trying to look over together. In fact, I bet you’ll get to see it really soon. I’ll ask Haylee, okay?”

Still looking dejected, Halo lowered his head and slunk off toward the trees. “Yeah, okay. ‘Really soon.’” Audrey winced at her own poor forethought and reaction to Halo’s confusion. ''There’s no reason he shouldn’t know, especially since a battle just happened… but I really need to check with Haylee first. She probably still thinks I’m asleep.''

She stumbled past the huddling Defenders until she found Haylee talking with Toxic, saying something about wings. She waited from a distance until they had finished their conversation, after which Toxic noticed her. “Hey, Audrey! Are you good? You kept waking up for two seconds and, like, blinking super fast, and then you’d conk right back out. Ever since the battle.”

“I mean, I ''feel'' fine,” Audrey said. “Thanks. Is that Jamaa Township up there?”

“Yup!” Haylee grinned at her. “Glad to hear you’re doing well, Audrey. It’s been a few days of getting here since you’ve been out, but we’ll be able to reach the new bunker by the afternoon. Obviously we’ve had to rearrange some things with the Mt. Shiveer mission… Marlenka and I agreed on having it go out a week from now, since we weren’t sure when you were going to wake up, but it was clear you were still fighting to.

“Also, the scouts didn’t think the ice prisons had anyone in them yet, so there’s no urgency in the sense that we had to head over the second you woke up. We figured that it’d be best to spend the time, if you were awake, teaching the others how to get wings and setting things up in our new home.” Haylee’s excited look faded. “We’ve been lucky in the sense that we’ve never had to move in the last two months of the year before, when it’s extra chilly out. There wasn’t enough time to prepare ''and'' there’s barely enough blankets and supplies for everyone.”

Audrey tried to remember having dreams or struggles about breaking free from whatever prolonged sleep she had been in that Marlenka apparently hadn’t. There was nothing – the last thing in her mental timeline that came before waking up was being given the scarf by Mira. Subconsciously she touched it with her claws. It had a texture like tinsel, and the silvery fabric seemed just as thin, but at the same time wherever it was wrapped around her felt as warm as if the scarf were made of faux fur.

“Okay, I’ll be good. I just came over here to check in, and also ask about the book. What are you planning on doing with it? Will you officially be training ''all'' the other Defenders to get their wings?”

Haylee nodded. “That’s one of the first things we plan to do when we stop at the bunker and unload our stuff. Toxic left the book with Raimu, since he saw it being tossed around during the move and wanted to take a closer look at it. It’s safe with him, don’t worry.”

“I can’t wait to see what everyone’s wings are going to look like!” exclaimed Toxic. “I’ve been ''dying'' to use mine again. We’re supposed to be covert about it for now so that we don’t start a stampede, but the land here is just so open. Perfect for catching some breeze.”

“Me too!” Audrey agreed, grinning. She looked over to see if she could spot Halo amidst all the other Defenders piled on top of each other, but he wasn’t in plain sight. ''I wish I didn’t scramble like that. Now it really looks like I’m keeping a secret from him.''

Despite the temperature, hatchlings and adult lizards alike rolled around on the ground and chatted with one another as if they were living perfectly normal lives, not threatened by phantoms for an instant. ''It won’t be long, though. In just a little while I’ll get to show him how it’s done, and then we can all watch him fly.''

==Chapter Seventeen - Blank - Halo’s POV==
Head beneath his shoulders, Halo skulked off toward the trees until he was sure he was out of Audrey’s eyesight. Then, feeling safe enough that he wouldn’t embarrass himself, he stopped. ''That was stupid,'' he scolded himself. ''Why did I just leave? Where did I think I was going?''

He glanced over his shoulder and, not seeing Audrey, turned back around to return to the Defenders’ general area. However, someone ''had'' been watching him. Halo reared back in surprise when bright orange scales entered his vision out of nowhere.

“Hey, where’d you come from?” Vatra asked him. She looked down at his empty claws. “You bring anything back?”

“No,” Halo muttered, but he knew he had no real reason to be grumpy with her when his problem was with Audrey. What was so special about this random book that her cool new De-friend-ers only wanted to share with ''her?''

Vatra tilted her head, and Halo went on. “Sorry. I’m just not really in a good mood. I guess I was… going for a walk, or something.”

“I can come with you. Uh, if you want, that is,” Vatra offered.

Halo didn’t feel like turning it down. Having someone else around would probably keep him from sulking too much, he reasoned. “Okay, let’s go.”

“Haylee!” Vatra called back. “Halo and I are going on a walk, okay?”

The orange lizard turned back around once she received acknowledgement from Haylee and let Halo lead the way through the forest. Just like their first trip together to gather leaves, it was pretty silent at the beginning except for the crunching of pebbles and twigs on the ground as they went. Vatra appeared to be deep in thought, but then she surprised him with a question. “Is this the furthest you’ve ever been from home?”

Halo tried to think of the places he had been outside Loafie’s den in Sarepia Forest. “Well… I’ve visited Crystal Sands a bunch. I don’t know how much further that is, though. My owner used to take us every year when it was warmest out,” he added.

“Who’s us?”

“Oh. Me and Audrey.”

Vatra put on a look like she was running algebraic calculations in her head. ''That’s basically her resting face, though,'' Halo thought. “Oh, yeah. I haven’t seen a lot of her since the battle. She seems cool, though. I mean, she must be if Mira was willing to give her alpha powers.”

She shook her head, impressed. “Only one other lizard besides Audrey and Marlenka has ''ever'' been an alpha, and that was Baylee. The one who guides and protects the lizards in fairytales.”

Halo frowned. He ran through a list of subjects he could change their conversation to in his head, but a bright green shape to Vatra’s right caught his eye. Warily, he blocked the way with his teal-and-cream tail. “Wait. What’s that?”

She squinted at what he saw, then brightened. “Don’t worry. It’s just Raimu.” Halo reluctantly followed her as she went to say hello to the other lizard. He was tempted to ask what he was doing so far from the other Defenders, just lying there, but then he saw the open book at the lizard’s claws. ''Is that'' ‘the’ ''book?''

Raimu’s green facial scales sparkled like an emerald, but the rest of him had a more rugged and weathered look. An orange baseball cap, turned backwards, dangled from one ear, while around his neck a red bowtie rested, covered in one or two dirt stains that looked considerably old. He didn’t seem shocked at all when Halo and Vatra came up to him, just blinking at the two of them with friendly eyes.

“Hi,” said Raimu. “Do you need anything?” Halo glanced down at the book. It was currently flipped open to a chapter titled ''Alpha Influence On Lizard Magic''.

“Just wanted to say hi.”

Raimu noticed Halo trying to read the book upside down. “It’s about how the elemental powers we lizards have get affected by alpha magic.”

The teal lizard winced. ''Geez, can I stop embarrassing myself?'' “Sorry. I was just curious.”

“It’s no problem. Haylee figured that this kind of knowledge would be relevant to the current happenings, so I’m studying it.” Raimu’s eyes became thoughtful. “Although… I’ve had to go back and read it a few times. I ''know'' I read and understood this same chapter two days ago… but I can only remember small bits of it. Like my memory keeps blanking out.”

In the corner of Halo’s eye, Vatra flinched. He felt a strange feeling at the other lizard’s words as well. ''Memory… blanking out.'' Yesterday Halo was so confused. He tried to think of what had first caused the Defenders to leave before the battle with the phantoms, but when he tried to find the answer, there was just nothing. His memories of the Defenders seemed to be divided into just two parts: ''before'' following Kaylee and Vatra to the battle, and ''after'' Mira’s visit. Everything else was blurry and white when he attempted to conjure it up in his brain.

“Me too,” Vatra began slowly. “It’s weird. I remember looking for leaves with Halo, but not anything else from that morning, or how long I was out there… There was something else, too, but I forgot. None of this happened before the battle.”

“Did you hit your head on something while you were fleeing?” asked Raimu.

Both Halo and Vatra shook their heads. “Yeah, I was lucky not to get hurt, but some of that weird phantom goop ''did'' land on us,” replied Halo. “It didn’t hurt, though. I just brushed it right off.”

Raimu’s eyes were filled with concern. “I was hit too. On the nose, literally.”

He closed the book’s front cover with a ''clap'' that spat millions of dusty particles into the sky, then hefted it onto his back. “I oughta tell Haylee that something might be going on. Maybe we can ask her whether any other lizards have been hit as well.”

“No,” Halo blurted. The other lizard stopped so suddenly that the heavy book nearly slid off his back. “Well… isn’t everything so frazzled right now? What’s the point of worrying Haylee when she’s been so busy organizing the gatherers and all that? It’s only been a few days, and at least for me, there’ve only been one or two… fuzzy patches… in my memory.”

When he said it, Halo expected to get shot down immediately by one of the Defenders – or both of them – asking him why he would hide things from Haylee like that. But they didn’t. Vatra nodded slowly and gave him a small smile of agreement while Raimu’s shoulders relaxed. “It’s kind of you to be thinking of her,” remarked Raimu. “I suppose it should be fine for now if we don’t rile anyone up. But let’s try and check in with one another if those blank-outs keep happening, ‘kay?”

The lizards needed to say no more; with that agreement, they were ready to return to the Defenders. Halo had planned on just taking a nap when he got back, but when they were about halfway there, Raimu stopped and asked him and Vatra: “Haylee was planning to use this book to teach us something once I brought it back. You guys wanna be the first to see what she’s got in store?”

==Chapter Eighteen - Inside - Bella’s POV==
Haylee had gathered a meeting of all the Defenders on a hill where the new bunker’s entrance was within sight. At the top of the grassy mount she stood beside Audrey, Marlenka, and Wooyoung, who were all staring down at the same ragged book.

Bella sat down with Millie near the front. “I wonder what’s going on?” said the gray lizard. “It’s been a good long while since Haylee called all of us together for a reason other than fleeing…”

“Beats me,” Bella shrugged. “I think I’ve only been to one of these before… looks like it might be about that book up there.”

Her friend squinted at it. “Oh, it’s hard to read the spine from a distance…”

“Alright, everyone,” said Haylee at last. “Some of you have been staring at this big ol’ book for a good while, but now it’s time to finally get to what’s inside. The night before we had to leave, Audrey-” She lightly bumped tails with the purple lizard beside her. “-found it in our storage room. We don’t know how it got there yet; did it belong to any of you?”

No one responded. Lizards glanced around, but all they saw were shrugs and head shakes. Haylee looked slightly puzzled that no one claimed the book, but it didn’t stop her from going on. “Okay. Well, this book is called ''Secret Talents of the Lizards.'' Most of you probably already know how to use your elemental powers. But there’s something else this book teaches how to do.”

Audrey whispered something to Wooyoung, who was quivering violently beside her. The little hatchling stopped shaking as much, smiled, and closed his eyes. When Bella blinked again, rainbows radiated from Wooyoung’s back and he was zipping around in the air as freely as a hummingbird in the air.

“Oh my!” Millie exclaimed. “Look at him go! He’s so fast up there.”

Most everyone who was watching was audibly shocked. Some of the Defenders just watched in awe while others cheered and whisted for Wooyoung until he landed again in front of Audrey’s claws. He glanced up at her with a gaping grin and she bumped noses with him joyously while the others chanted for him.

“Wings,” Haylee continued, unable to hide her excitement on her face. “All of you are gonna learn how to get some.”

From there, work was nearly nonstop. Half of the Defenders, led by Haylee, worked on moving the things they’d brought from Sarepia Forest into the new bunker while also exploring the things that had been left behind last. Although there were only a few more blankets to find in these barracks, the lizards were happy to discover plentiful boomseed stores waiting for them in one of the underground corridors.

While that portion of the group was busy, the others trained with Marlenka and Audrey to gain their wings, focusing on ramping up the speed of the summoning process and playing games to see who could get them the fastest and fly the highest. Then they rotated the next day, over and over, until a week had passed.

Everyone was gaining progress more quickly than expected. Skill with the wings proved to have no age restrictions – Millie was learning as fast as Wooyoung and the other hatchlings had, and she was among the quickest to summon her wings. Bella wondered what fond memories her friend was looking back on while she tried to gain them.

Bella still struggled herself. Her fastest time was half a minute, and now that her first flight back in Sarepia Forest had passed, she could barely reach the same heights. Once again she fell into the gray space in her mind where she couldn’t be truly happy for anyone else because of her own difficulties.

''And my wings,'' she kept thinking. ''My wings look just like phantom tentacles. Everybody sees it, and everybody knows it.''

Millie was no stranger to when she was in that sort of place. “You’re hardly ever training anymore,” she said with concern. Bella had volunteered to help clean and prepare the new bunker all day for the last two days, exempting herself from the rotation where she would get to practice with her wings. “Do you want to talk about it?”

“Um…” Bella hesitated. “There’s not much to tell. I just don’t feel into it right now. No use training when it requires positive energy and all, right?”

Millie sat down next to her. “Well, let me know if I can do anything to help. Haylee’s been appreciating all your work with the nests, I bet you.”

“Yeah, she talked to me earlier,” sighed Bella. “I wonder if I should’ve waited, though. I mean, most of the setting up is probably done now that it’s been days, but Haylee ''and'' Audrey are leaving for her mission tomorrow morning and I’ll… almost be all alone. And then Marlenka will be back soon enough, and she’ll want me to keep training regardless of what I want to do.”

Just a couple of the Defenders knew about Bella’s issues with Marlenka. Bella suspected that Haylee and Audrey were aware by observation, but Millie was the only one she felt she could talk about it with. Haylee was too convinced, in Bella’s opinion, that she could change Marlenka’s mind about her. She was lucky to have someone like Millie to be able to vent to without unrealistic reassurances thrown in.

“Maybe Audrey will be willing to spend some one-on-one time helping you with your wings when she’s back,” suggested Millie.

That idea didn’t work for Bella, though. “She works too hard. It wouldn’t be right to take a good teacher away from everyone else just because ''I'' can’t do it.”

Millie let her claws rest on the younger lizard’s shoulder. “You ''can'' fly,” she said. “You’re just trying to do it with a roof above your head.”

The sun went down and Bella still lay outside with her friend, watching the Defenders march into the bunker until she was sure every one of them was tucked away into the fresh-made nests.

==Chapter Nineteen - Ice - Audrey’s POV==
The Defenders who were going on the mission the next morning were wished well by a sizable crowd of lizards who Audrey was surprised to find already awake. The journey to Mt. Shiveer would take almost the whole day, hence why the party planned to leave so early, but she didn’t doubt that they’d accomplish the objective they had set out to, and all in good time.

“Be safe,” Bella told Haylee and Audrey shyly. Her friend Millie, an older gray and pastel-green lizard, brought them a fuzzy blanket on her back. Audrey recognized it as the blanket Halo had been wearing, and as soon as she did, Halo himself appeared among the mass.

“Bye,” he said, his cheeks still a little pink.

Another lizard saw Halo talking and came up to his side. “Goodbye and good luck, Haylee! And Audrey too,” she said.

“See you, Vatra,” Haylee replied. “Thanks for the blanket, you guys. Don’t forget to keep warm.”

Vatra scoffed. “We’ll try to keep that in mind.”

“I know I’m coming with you, but I feel the need to say it. Don’t die, Purple,” Marlenka advised Audrey earnestly from her other side. “Mira would probably find it really inconvenient to have to pick a new moon alpha for the second time in a week.”

“Yeah, I’ll do my best.” Audrey chuckled.

Big Bird scrambled over to Haylee, tossing up leaves with his claws as he went, as if he had a wildly important message to deliver before she went on her way. When he finally reached her, gasping for air, he started singing. “Na na na na… na na na na… hey hey hey… good-”

No sooner could he finish his line before Banana, his bright-yellow acquaintance, caught up to him and gave him a smack to remember.

A few hours after the group of seven set off for the mountains, a solid layer of snow began to appear under their claws. “Is it like this all year?” asked Cakepop.

“I believe so,” Raimu answered her. “At least, based on the almanacs I’ve read, it’s always cold enough in Mt. Shiveer to maintain a year-round temperature that lets the snow sit.”

Cakepop bent her head and licked it. “Yuck,” she muttered. “I thought it would be like powdered sugar… but yikes, it ''tastes'' as wet as it feels.”

Audrey walked with Haylee, who had given the blanket to Cakepop and Toxic to share behind them, in the front of the group while Marlenka kept watch from the back. They were clustered together, mostly for security, but also for warmth; the closer they got to the mountains, the more powerful the breeze, which meant even more snow in the air.

“The rumors are that the phantoms are running out of prison space,” Haylee was telling her grimly. “Apparently, they lost a lot of it because they’re trying to keep the alphas separated and as powerless as possible.”

She fixed a determined smile on the whiteness ahead of her. “I bet they don’t know a thing about the alphas not having their power anymore. They should have no clue that their plan to keep alpha magic out of this war was far from successful.”

“Are they doing anything about it?” asked Audrey.

Haylee went on. “The rumors also say that they’re ''making'' more prisons in the lands of Jamaa, so that they don’t have to carry the jammers they trap all the way back to the phantom fortress every time and also to conserve the room that’s left. So we think based on scout news that there are ice cells being set up near the mountains. Just the building part for now; no prisoners yet, although we can expect to meet some enemies while we’re there.”

Once again Audrey became curious of her own alpha powers. What would they be able to do to destroy the ice prisons? Would she just know what to do when the time came?

Another gust of wind zoomed over the group. Toxic audibly shuddered; Cakepop was clinging to his back, the white blanket draped over both of them, but still the cold managed to ridge itself between their scales. Also in that row were Eira, who had been mostly silent for the duration of the trip, and Raimu, on whose shoulder she now leaned.

Haylee shivered as well. Audrey was surprised the pink-and-blue lizard’s teeth weren’t chattering already. She looked down at the iridescent scarf around her own neck. “Do you want to wear this?” Audrey offered, watching the fringed ends of the scarf as they fluttered past her face.

“Oh, no, no,” Haylee said. She tucked her tail around her back leg. “If I were you, I wouldn’t take off a gift from Mira like that, just in case. We don’t want the fabric of the world to come undone or anything.”

“You and Audrey can take a turn with this blanket, Haylee,” suggested Toxic from where he trotted at her tail. Faintly, Audrey could hear Cakepop squeak in protest.

“Or we can cuddle,” Marlenka added flatly.

Haylee shook her head gratefully. “Ah, thanks, you guys. But we won’t be here for too long. See how we’ve traveled a lot farther since we haven’t taken rest stops?”

“I hate traveling in a huge group for that exact reason,” spat Cakepop. “Sure, the Defenders are great for protection… but wow, they oughta work on their speed.”

Toxic snickered. “Where have you been going that ''wasn’t'' in a ‘huge group’ recently, Popcorn?”

“You gotta stop with the nicknames,” Marlenka said.

“I’m kind of amazed how quickly you come up with them, though,” remarked Audrey.

The red-and-gold lizard stared at her with such mock shock that it looked like the white sun mark on her head was glowing. “Wow. Okay then, I rescind my cuddle offer.”

“I thought I was the one being given that offer,” Haylee put in.

“Nuh-uh. You’re letting all this slide.”

“Springs,” Raimu blurted out of nowhere.

The seven-lizard party stopped in the snow. If Audrey squinted, she could see a pool of teal and blue water swirling together, surrounded by rock formations that puffed steam as surely as chimneys… and beside them, a pale cylinder with bars of ice.

==Chapter Twenty - Hunt - Dragon’s POV==
“It’s cold,” Skip whined.

Julie ignored him. Dragon didn’t usually agree with Skip, and he never felt obligated to because the other lizard was always shoving him around… but he couldn’t help but feel a little bit of resentment that Julie didn’t care about keeping either of them warm at all.

''What can I expect, I guess,'' Dragon told himself. But it still made the snow under his claws feel a little colder watching Julie simply float above it as phantoms could do.

Already the mountains were coming into view amid the blizzard-like sheen over the land up ahead. Worker phantoms had reported to the king that two lizards were seen near an area where ice prisons were being built – presumably Defenders, since they weren’t with owners – and so Julie and her two lizards were sent to hunt them down.

Dragon had nothing to keep himself warm, so he just let his fuzzy brain guide four numb legs over the snow layer. At one point, Skip was so fed up with the temperature that he jumped onto one of Julie’s tentacles and clung there, but the purple phantom just shook him off into a snowbank in the distance. He came scrambling back moments later and never tried that again.

“How are we going to know where to look for them?” asked Dragon.

Julie glared at him. “Why don’t you keep your jaws shut before they freeze together,” she snapped at him, but then she proceeded to answer his question anyway. “They’re not going to go all the way in here because they wouldn’t realistically be prepared enough for the temperature. But they went west, or so the idiot scouts were saying, so they’re either in Jamaa Township or Appondale.”

She quit her calculating monologue and half closed her eye at her lizard sidekicks. “How well do you think a hundred lizards are gonna be able to hide themselves in a place with barely any cover?”

“No one ‘kin hide from ''us'', Miss Julie!” Skip grinned.

A small number of phantoms were milling around the area once Julie, Dragon, and Skip reached the springs. A few ice prisons had successfully been set up, although their proportions were strange and they didn’t look exceptionally sturdy.

''I knew phantoms were never too great at construction, considering the fortress was mostly built by forced labor of their prisoners… but this lot might get yelled at.'' Dragon bit his lip, bracing himself as he saw Julie float faster toward the other phantoms.

“Get outta here,” she ordered them. “We don’t need you getting in the way. Tell the phantom king we’re on the lizards’ trail.”

Without question, they abandoned their work – or wandering – and sped off in the direction of the phantom fortress. “I really hope they’re here,” Dragon said nervously, referring to the Defenders.

“They are.” Julie exhaled. “I can smell them.”

A group of moving dots of color froze in the distance. The rocky formations by the nearest blue-and-teal pool whistled as more steam shot through them.

“Do they see us?” Dragon whispered.

Skip’s head appeared in the corner of his eye. “They see their demise,” he growled.

Without turning toward either of them, Julie quickly extended a tentacle in their direction as if she were about to splat some good old-fashioned goop on their face. It was a common gesture among the phantoms that translated most simply to ''shut up or I’ll shut'' you ''up.''

The shapes in the distance began moving again. “You know what to do,” Julie muttered at her two lizards. And they did.

==Chapter Twenty-One - Fire - Audrey’s POV==
“Well, they’re really here,” said Haylee. She paused, whispering to herself and nodding like she was counting the number of ice cells in sight. “I’m not sure whether that’s more a good thing or a bad thing, but now we can do something about it.”

“Can you?” said a voice. Before anyone could question it, a phantom – a lighter, more vibrant shade of purple than Audrey had ever seen one be – revealed itself from behind one of the prison structures.

From either side of her, two lizards stepped into view. One was snarling at the Defenders as fiercely as if it were a feral creature, while the other just scowled at them with a more withdrawn stance.

Cakepop rubbed her eyes. “Am I dreaming, or did a weird ''light purple'' phantom just choose a dramatic villain entrance over, I don’t know, stealth?”

“Oh, purple doesn’t really hide itself too well against the snow,” the amused phantom replied. Her gaze fixed mockingly on Audrey. “Although I suppose that’s a lesson you’ve yet to learn, huh?”

Audrey narrowed her eyes at the strangely colored creature, although she guessed she didn’t look nearly as threatening. “How many friends you got with you, phantom?” Toxic asked her aggressively. “Just show them already. I wanna see how many eyes we’re about to take out with this little scuffle.”

The phantom raised her tentacle to stop him. “No, please, call me Julie.” The purple-and-gold lizard at her side looked up at her with wicked excitement as if expecting her to introduce him next, but his expression dropped when she just kept going. “You’re lookin’ right at all the ''friends'' who hunted your quivering little pack all the way to the mountains.” She grinned at them with her eye. “You wanna make the first move or should I?”

Audrey was still confused. There was no way this was all they’d be fighting against… it was just one phantom up against seven Defenders.

But she was so engulfed in that puzzlement that she forgot about the two lizards accompanying Julie. The purple-and-gold one moved fast as a dart and barreled straight into Audrey, clawing at her face and pulling away on Mira’s scarf like he was trying to rip it off her neck.

She kicked him in the side, but it wasn’t until a second later that Marlenka dived forward and hauled him off her by the back of his head. The muscle-bound lizard picked him right back up off the snow where he’d landed and tossed him even further into the distance with just one arm, but once he landed it was like he’d never even hit the ground. He raced back toward them and went for Cakepop and Toxic instead, occupying both of them while the second lizard finally made a move and went up against Eira and Raimu.

“Haylee!” Raimu exclaimed. “Do you think you and Audrey can take care of this one? I have a plan to handle the prisons… but it needs time, and also someone who can keep those rats off our backs while Eira and I work on it.”

Haylee bobbed her head firmly and signaled to Audrey to follow her. The second lizard, this one with green and yellow scales, chased after Eira and Raimu as expected as they bolted for the hot springs, but the two Defenders were right on his tail until he whirled around suddenly, sprayed snow in their faces with a 90-degree kick, and kept haring after his targets.

At first the sudden snowy blast left Haylee and Audrey sputtering, but Haylee shook out her head and pointed upwards after just a few moments. “Fly!” she ordered Audrey. In just three seconds, Haylee had summoned her own wings – glowing green spirals of light that swirled over her back in the shape of a butterfly – and Audrey didn’t take much longer.

It was colder up in the sky, but the evil lizard they chased had no idea they were there. He paused his pursuit of Eira and Raimu very briefly, looking backwards with confusion at no longer seeing the Defenders coming after him, and Haylee chose that moment to drop down on him from the sky. She delivered a midair punt that sent him sprawling face-first onto the ground, which cleared the way for Audrey to land on his back and pin him there.

Silver wings flared out, Audrey’s image was almost as fearsome as Julie’s. The power she felt inside of her commanded her to widen her eyes like an instinct, and when she did, all the light had sucked itself out of the vision of the lizard underneath her so that it was concentrated completely in her eyes. Confident that he wouldn’t be able to move, she looked back to the hot springs to see what Eira and Raimu were up to.

Eira was busy hollowing out a piece of rock – which was starting to look more like a bowl – while Raimu dipped an already-hollowed piece into the springs and seemed to filter the water with his claws. Once it was almost full, with the water inside of it looking clouded white, he ran it to the nearest ice prison and dumped the water on top of it, heading back immediately.

It took a short while for anything to happen, but then Audrey saw what he had done; the ice of the bars and roof became thinner and thinner until it melted entirely. ''The salt from the spring water is making it go away faster,'' Audrey realized. ''Raimu’s a genius!''

Even though one of Julie’s lizards was pinned, the first one was still as energetic as ever. Toxic was half buried in a snowbank, panting like crazy with a couple of nasty-looking scratches drawn across his face. Cakepop appeared to be trying to dig him out while simultaneously holding off the enemy lizard’s rapid attacks, and Marlenka was trying to claw Julie, who just spun in circles around her and cackled every time she missed.

Finally Julie noticed that only one of her lizards was still available to fight and glanced over at Audrey, whose wings folded and then disappeared, to see him squirming but otherwise immobile underneath her. Raimu splashed yet another cell with spring water, and the first one was now completely eaten away by the salt. Julie rose up into the air, just out of Marlenka’s jumping reach, and glowered at Audrey. “Oh, that won’t do,” she muttered darkly.

Marlenka seemed to be contemplating whether to summon her wings and keep chasing after Julie, but instead she went over to help drag the purple-and-gold lizard away from Toxic. Julie hardly even looked at her, clapping two tentacles together with alarming volume.

At once, both of her lizards turned in her direction; the attacking one abandoned his struggle with Toxic and returned to Julie, still growling at the Defenders. The lizard Audrey had pinned extended his legs from his sides and pushed himself up off the ground forcefully, knocking Audrey into the snow, but rather than continuing to try and fight her he raced up to Julie’s other side.

“What’s going on?” Cakepop squeaked. Before Raimu could return to the springs, a purple flame rose up out of the ground and spread until it was like a wall, nearly encircling him. He yelped and fell back, burnt on his nose and forearms, and the fire wall pushed him over to where Cakepop, Toxic, and Audrey were. The fire then reshaped itself and surrounded them in a ring, slowly closing in on them as Julie floated above tauntingly.

Audrey’s teeth chattered. At first she thought it was just the cold seeping into her scales, but then she realized her vision had gotten lighter and she could feel her own eyes glowing as she zoomed forward at supersonic speed and rammed into Julie with her wings as wide and powerful as three heavy phantoms.

''This is what my alpha powers are for.''

==Chapter Twenty-Two - Marks - Audrey’s POV==
The sheen of shimmering whiteness cleared from Audrey’s eyes. She didn’t feel tired or worn out – just cold, the temperature of the mountains sinking back into her scales as if it had been momentarily pushed out by a wave of heat. Julie and her lizards were nowhere to be seen.

“That was ''awesome'', Audrey!” Toxic said at once. “Those must have been the perk thingies you got when Mira made you an alpha. Coooool.”

Audrey glanced at her claws. They seemed to be glittering when she first saw them, but then the sparkles disappeared. “I guess so. But what happened to… ''them?''”

Marlenka curled her tail in the direction of a snowbank some lengths past where the group was huddled. “Last we saw, you punched ‘em real good into that little sugar pile. The stupid tentacled one probably busted on contact, and I imagine the lizards aren’t conscious, so we should be clear to skedaddle.”

Audrey gasped and drew her head closer to her shoulders. “Wait. You mean you want to leave them here? To freeze? We know Julie’s a phantom and all, but the lizards are just misguided…”

A narrow-eyed look from Marlenka’s ruby eyes cut her off. “Those lizards are the enemy, Audrey. They work with the phantoms by choice. I’m not dragging them out of the snow and saving their sorry lives just because they look like us.”

The purple lizard wished she could argue, but she didn’t have a clue what to say. She just waited for Haylee to speak instead, eyes averted. “Alright, let’s go,” Haylee said to break the awkward silence. “Good job with your powers, Audrey. And also-”

In the center of the group, a blue sphere of pure light emerged from the snow beneath their claws, humming with energy and swirling over their heads until it burst in the air. White and blue sparks sliced across the sky like petals from a flower grown by Mira herself. With the explosion came a blast of light that momentarily blinded all the lizards and sent them stumbling on their tails – but when Audrey blinked again, Raimu, Eira, and Haylee were all levitating in the air without their wings.

The dissipated shards of light moved back towards the center where they had coursed out from, slowly at first and then rapidly enough that another blink would have caused Audrey to miss it. The reformed ball of light split into three smaller orbs, one drifting into the hearts of each floating lizard. Toxic shook Audrey’s shoulder excitedly as he watched a white mark appear on Haylee, Eira, and Raimu’s foreheads. At last the lizards were lowered back onto the snow, the sky bleak and white as if nothing had happened.

“Are you guys alphas now?” Toxic blurted as soon as the shine of wonder faded from their eyes. His wide grin took up the larger half of his face.

Haylee blinked at the others who had been lifted into the air alongside her. “Eira- you have this star on your forehead…the chart from ''Secret Talents of the Lizards'' indicated that that means you’re the alpha of magic, like Peck was. And Raimu, you have a gear…”

Raimu nodded. The shape was only half visible beneath the brim of his orange baseball cap. “That I remember. I suppose this means I’ve been granted powers as the tech alpha, or Graham’s proxy. Yours has a leaf, Haylee. The nature alpha.”

Beside Toxic, Cakepop’s eyes were sparkling. “Woooooah!! Did we just get all of the remaining alphas at once, then?!”

Still in a state of shock, Haylee made a face like she was doing the math in her head; Audrey noticed that instead of solid sky blue, her eyes had a tinge of pastel green at the tops. “No,” she said uncertainly. “There were six alphas to replace. Liza, Peck, Graham, Sir Gilbert, Cosmo, and Greely. And… six types… moon, magic, tech, sun, nature, and… phantom. So there’s one left to be named.”

Cakepop tilted her head. “Wait, there’s a phantom alpha? Why?”

“Greely was the former one,” Raimu explained to her. “I found some insightful notes in one particular chapter of the book. Its writer theorized that Greely was the first to establish the position of a phantom alpha because he was the first to try – and succeed – at learning and comprehending phantom tactics as a means to defeat them. He lives by the warning to know your enemy.”

All of a sudden, Marlenka’s concerned look returned. “Wait. ‘Know your enemy?’ Look, look, I don’t wanna question the decisions made by Mira and Zios, since from the looks of it, they already have an idea of who they want to pick and just wait for the opportunity of catching that lizard in their best moment to grant them powers then. But… what if Mira and Zios are being misled?”

Toxic tilted his head. “What do you mean?”

Marlenka looked at Audrey, and then at Haylee. “There’s a spy in the Defenders. I ''know'' it. Some kind of double agent is telling the phantoms where to find us while appearing to help the Defenders at the same time. What if Mira and Zios think that this mole is being loyal to both sides to try and ‘know our enemy’ for the good of the Defenders or whatever?”

Audrey felt the need to step in. “I’m not sure about that. Can’t Mira and Zios see into our hearts and know what we really want? Even if there was a double agent, they would be able to tell what side they were ''really'' working for.”

“There ''is'' a double agent, Audrey.” Marlenka’s face and voice was dripping with exasperation. “We just need to catch them in the act.”

“Marlenka,” Haylee said rigidly. “Please do your best to trust in your fellow Defenders. We have lizards on watch at all times; they would be able to catch anyone who’s slipping off to the phantoms without permission.”

The red-and-gold lizard didn’t argue, but she held Haylee’s stare for as long as their eyes were locked. Then Haylee swept her tail across the snow, Toxic at her side with Cakepop on his back, and led the way back to Jamaa Township.

==Chapter Twenty-Three - Memory - Dragon’s POV==
Dragon groaned, the snow that completely surrounded his body starting to hurt more than it made him just feel cold. “Quiet,” Julie hissed at him. “They aren’t gone yet.”

A few more minutes passed. By now almost every part of Dragon had gone numb, his brain included, but at last Julie dragged him and Skip out of the snow.

“Well, they’ve left now,” Julie growled. “Breaking a fall is one thing the two of you don’t do so badly. Move, we need to follow them before the stupid blizzard or whatever this is hides them from us.”

“But ''Julieeeee!''” Skip exclaimed with protest. Once again he jumped up with his sole bit of strength and gripped Julie’s tentacle. “I can’t feel my anything!”

Julie gave him a bitter look. “You’re walking. Or should I punt you there instead?”

The purple-and-gold lizard nodded his head so violently Dragon wondered if a particularly strong gust of wind could carry it away. “Yes pleeeeease!”

Grunting with annoyance, Julie flared her light-purple eye and extended a purple flame from the tentacle that Skip was clinging to, setting the lizard on fire. Dragon watched her toss him in front of her and then kick him into the unforeseeable distance while he screamed and then vanished into the thick sky.

“Get a move on, scale-face,” Julie snapped at Dragon. She clopped him with another tentacle while she floated off to see where Skip landed. Teal eyes narrowed against the snow, which was blowing off the ground and through the air right at his face, he forced his limp legs to move after her.

“What do we do now?” Dragon asked her cautiously while the phantom dug a frantic Skip up.

Finally Julie succeeded at hauling him out. “And walk on your claws from now on or it’ll happen again.” The threat was spared no vocal venom. “Now we have to lure them somewhere. Into a trap, so that we can get Haylee alone and return her to the king.”

She rubbed two tentacles together eagerly at the thought. “Haylee was all we promised, and all we were asked for… but boy, I can just ''picture'' the look on Lido’s face when all the rest of the Defenders come after us, searching for their leader, and ''I'' did it single-tentacledly without a need for half-trained armies trained by a half-wit excuse for a general.”

“What about us?” Skip complained.

“''You'' will come with me and chase them someplace. Don’t kill them, though; the more Defenders we can take back to the fortress, the more impressive he’ll find us. Ideally that ‘someplace’ is the first tree we see once we’re officially off this loathsome snow. That’s the place where ''Dragon''-” She patted the green-and-yellow lizard on the head again. He hated when she did that. As if he was a pet, like those meek little Defenders.

“-will have the trap made and ready. Dragon, dig out a wide space in front of the tree and pace around it. Make sure to talk about the phantoms a lot, so they’ll want to attack you.”

''Great,'' Dragon thought to himself, but he could never even mumble it as long as Julie was within a mile of him. “Yes, Miss Julie.”

“We split up now so that they can’t get any farther ahead. Don’t screw this up, Dragon. Skip, show me those fangs. Wider!”

And then Dragon was alone in the snow. Far from the phantom fortress, and soon when he began to hobble in the opposite direction, far from Julie and Skip, the phantom proponents he always seemed to be stuck with.

He wondered what Bella’s life was like. He hadn’t seen her in two full years. ''And even after that much time, I still don’t know how to feel about it.''

The scene was still clear and colorful in his mind – as colorful as the phantom fortress could be with its dark-purple walls and black turrets built brick by brick by prisoners of the phantoms themselves. The energy of their labor was carried over into the appearance of the bastion itself; just looking at it incited a deep feeling of interminable hopelessness. Yet the unmoving walls were the scene of a terrifying battle. Sir Gilbert and his wretched tiger troopers were as close to infiltrating the fortress as they had ever been, and Dragon and Bella – named Phantom at the time – were smack dab in the heart of it.

Bella got her birth name from a nickname that she was called by the other lizards when she was a very young hatchling for having dark-purple scales just like many of their tentacled keepers. However, she perhaps, or so Dragon and the others had thought, was the least like the phantoms of all of those raised in the fortress. She never roamed the halls looking to pick a fight. She never stole comfort from the other lizards. And she ''never'' stuck up for herself when they picked on her for how little of a “real lizard” she was.

When she was caught peeling one of many banners off the wall so that she could keep the both of them warm that night, Dragon saw no other choice but to step in and claim responsibility for it. He was both frustrated that she was the other lizards’ clawing bag ''and'' frustrated that she never tried to fight back – but he didn’t regret a moment of his punishment as long as it meant she would be okay.

Julie saw how diligent he was and wanted him to come work with her to advance her “''great plans''” for Jamaa and the phantom kingdom. His decision to accept was the only thing he and Bella ever disagreed on.

So as their friendship continued to grow for their entire hatchlinghoods leading into the young adult stage of their life, Bella staying mostly the same while Dragon learned to protect himself when necessary and striving to teach her to do the same thing, she repaid him by leaving.

“Phantom, you’re going to get caught,” Dragon remembered trying to convince her in the battle’s midst. She had told him she planned to leave the phantom fortress, find a new life for herself by seeking out those “Defenders” the phantoms were always complaining about. But he didn’t think to take those words seriously until she ascended the fortress’s lookout wall so that she could escape through the surrounding woods. “You’ll be killed!”

Bella shook her head. “I won’t be killed.” But she didn’t sound certain until she went on: “If Julie and the king get what they want, ''everything'' will be destroyed.”

“Phantom- ''Phantom!''” He chased after her as she broke away from him and raced for the woods, dodging past phantom soldiers and tiger troopers alike. He tackled her to the ground as she gasped, pinning her there under his claws and the fierce teal gaze he’d only ever used on other lizards who dared bother him. The expression that Julie alone had helped him master. “If you run away,” he snarled, “You’ll be on the wrong side of the phantoms’ wrath. You. ''Won’t.'' Survive.”

Bella kicked him in the chest and sliced her claws across his face. He was so dumbfounded at what she did that he basically let her do it. Her shadow fell over his face. “I’m Bella now,” she told him. The tone of her voice was as freezing as the chill that drove her to steal the banner years before. “No longer a pet ward for the phantoms. My ''name'' is no longer Phantom.”

It was the one brave thing she ever did in her life, as far into her life as Dragon had ever gotten to see. He didn’t even know if she was still alive.

As the tops of the trees ahead finally came into view, Dragon wondered if he would ever find the same courage as she did, for that one moment, enough to never be found by the phantoms again. He knew it was treasonous to let the thought even cross his mind, but that fact didn’t stop his dazed brain from fantasizing about it.

==Chapter Twenty-Four - Progression - Halo’s POV==
Sundown was fast approaching when Haylee’s party of seven arrived back to their new bunker on the fringe of Jamaa Township. It didn’t take long for any of the Defenders to notice that three of their comrades were returning with a unique white symbol on their foreheads.

“Mira and Zios have chosen three more Defenders as replacement alphas,” said Haylee, her voice clear enough that all the lizards above ground could hear her.

As her voice reverberated through the grass, more heads popped up out of the tunnel to the barracks to listen. “I have been given powers as the nature alpha, Raimu the tech alpha, and Eira the magic alpha. It was a brave fight up in Mt. Shiveer, and we did encounter a phantom… but the ice prisons, or at least the ones that existed, are no longer, and we’ve successfully offset the phantoms’ plans for some time.” The way Haylee paused after saying “a phantom” made Halo think there was something else to say, but she didn’t go back to it if there was.

“All three of us are proud to continue defending Jamaa with the abilities we have been granted alongside Audrey and Marlenka.” The three new alphas bowed their heads to the watching Defenders, who cheered and tossed their blankets around. “We’ve also decided that with all the stress and intensity of the past week, it would be a good idea to take a group of Defenders into town to just relax, buy some blankets and food and all that. All of us-” she swept her tail to indicate the group that had gone on the mission- “except for Marlenka and Cakepop will be coming, so if you’re interested, feel free to join. We leave in ten minutes.”

Halo had decided to be a part of the trip into town after Vatra expressed interest. It didn’t feel like an obligation to him that he had to go because she was going – wanting to come along just felt natural, like they’d get to do something fun together out of… friendship? The word felt strange for him to use about anyone other than Audrey.

Vatra wanted to spend time with him, though, even when he didn’t want to be spoken to – or if Audrey didn’t want to speak to him. It seemed like she was hardly ever talking to him anymore.

He didn’t want to focus on that, though. The starlight made it hard to discern details, but Jam Mart Clothing had undergone a significant refurbishment as the phantom war gradually worsened, and now it was a place where hot drinks were made and sold in the back. Many of the clothes had become pawmade instead of manufactured. Blankets covered jagged holes in the wooden walls of the castle-like structure where heavy phantoms had once smashed through.

Immediately, Halo saw Audrey head for the drink station, Toxic beside her. When she ordered her hot chocolate he was near certain she asked if they had any cinnamon to go with it.

Closer to the door were Vatra and Halo, enjoying the heating system. He hadn’t felt generated warmth like this since living in Loafie’s den, but there was no telling when or if Vatra had experienced anything similar. “How are you enjoying the heat for once?” he asked her.

Vatra blinked up at the dim lights. “''So'' good, Halo. If only I could stay here for a while and study whatever’s keeping this building so warm, build some kind of portable heat device that can bring that to the Defenders. Like… a bonfire you can wear.”

“That description fits the old white blanket well,” Halo grumbled good-naturedly. “Whoever’s using it now better be enjoying it, because ''both'' of us are freezing our tails off now.”

The other lizard chuckled, but it was soon cut off when she saw Raimu and an elegant-looking purple lizard heading their way. “Very sorry to interrupt you,” Raimu told them earnestly. He tilted his head toward the lizard next to him. “I wanted to let you know that I told Eira about the blank-outs. Mine seem to be getting worse… but Eira hasn’t had any at all.”

“Perhaps I just don’t feel it when they happen,” Eira suggested.

But Raimu shook his head. “I fear that if you have them, you ''can'' sense it. Strongly. Right, you two?” Halo and Vatra nodded.

“Eira didn’t get hit by the special phantom goop during that battle,” Vatra mused aloud. “So maybe it ''is'' connected. We really should ask more of the Defenders just to be sure, since I think the three of us were the only ones who came into contact with it…”

“We can’t cause a panic either, though,” Halo put in. He figured that Raimu had told Eira about the blank-outs because he trusted her closely enough to handle the knowledge in a responsible way. Then he wondered why he himself had never told Audrey.

Raimu sighed. “So once again it stays with us. Do either of you have anyone you would want to ask who you know wouldn’t react explosively?”

Neither Vatra nor Halo nodded at the question.

“I can’t remember anything at all from today past the point when Audrey and everyone left,” Halo said. “Or… Marlenka’s training sessions. If you took me outside right now and asked me to summon my wings, I don’t know if I could do that quickly.”

The green-and-cream lizard in front of him and Vatra exchanged looks with Eira. “Apologies again for pausing your conversation,” said Eira. She lowered her head slightly, and the white star on it seemed to glow. “All we needed was to check in so that I could write it down in his notes.”

“His notes?” Halo cocked his head.

Eira nodded with a solemn expression. “Raimu can’t always remember the information he’s learned anymore. I must write it for him so that none of his findings are touched by his condition.”

Vatra and Halo said goodbye to them and then the two lizards walked off to an unknown spot in the store. “This is bad,” Vatra murmured.

“Maybe.” Halo stood up. “We’ll get through it. Besides, Raimu’s an alpha now; his new magic has ''got'' to overpower whatever’s affecting his memory.” When the orange lizard still didn’t look convinced, he put his claws on her shoulder comfortingly. “C’mon. We don’t need to think about it right now; we came here to be warm and have a little fun in the midst of the war.”

It took a second, but the corner of Vatra’s mouth lifted and she got to her claws too. “Okay… you’re right. Where should we go first?” She glanced at the drink station, in the corner of the building where the overhead light was weakest. “Are you maybe… thirsty?”

==Chapter Twenty-Five - Out - Bella’s POV==
Bella was feeling just fine when Haylee and the other Defenders went into the town. She was too tired to come along and guessed that Haylee and Audrey, probably the only ones she’d have talked with since Millie stayed in the barracks whenever possible, would just be discussing alpha stuff. They had more important things to attend to than her.

It made her anxious at first that Marlenka was one of the only ones from the mission who had opted to stay behind, but most of her nerves were eased when the red-and-gold lizard made her way underground without a word and shut herself away in her nest.

As long as she left Bella alone, Bella was just fine with that, although she had to wonder what had gotten Marlenka so worked up when everyone else from the mission seemed just relieved to be home.

But the peace didn’t last long. Bella only slept for about an hour before she was shaken awake by a lizard she didn’t know. Frantically she blinked up at the dirt roof of the underground bunker above her head, glad to still be lying where she had fallen asleep, but several other Defenders were standing in the nesting room with uneasy looks.

“Something’s chasing them” was all the lizard said, and then they went off to wake someone else up.

Like instinct Bella went to find Millie and ask her what was going on, but with everyone clustered and unmoving she was impossible to find, not to mention the trail of Defenders spilled up through the passage leading back to the aboveground. Bella shifted awkwardly through the mass until dark blades of grass struggled beneath her claws. She still couldn’t see Millie no matter how far around she turned-

Then she saw it. In the distance, a line of purple followed a small group of multicolored dots. Several other Defenders watched with her, squinting at the shapes and trying to make out what was following the dots, which appeared to be lizard-shaped. Dead silence occupied the land, no leaf daring to rustle.

The purple line was glowing.

''They’re getting chased by fire.''

Someone shouted it out before Bella could articulate her realization. Defenders raced both towards and away their comrades while she debated with herself which way to run. The flames were growing crisper now in her vision. Some of them licked at the trees themselves, leaving blackness and absence of life wherever they coursed. The fire was like a wall, pushing steadily toward Haylee’s group and moving them toward the barracks.

“Get everyone out of the bunker,” Bella heard Haylee shout. “No possessions, just ''get out.'' I don’t want her sending the fire through the only exit, they’ll be trapped in there!”

“What about the book?” someone else screeched. No one answered them.

''Her?'' It took Bella a few seconds to register what had just been said. But as the purple blaze grew closer and more lizards rushed past, no more time had passed than Bella received her answer.

Floating behind the fire, lavender eye glowing like a torch, waving her tentacles in the air as she manipulated its direction, was the one creature Bella feared more than Marlenka: Julie the phantom. The monster her old friend Dragon had worked with and learned from no matter how many times Bella warned him of how devious she was. To that day she still blamed Julie for turning Dragon into the mindless underling she couldn’t force herself to say she recognized.

There was no time to think. Bella ran with the outskirts of the moving Defenders, glancing back every now and then to ensure that the fire hadn’t traveled into the bunker entrance. Strangely, it hadn’t. It almost seemed like Julie was maneuvering the fire in such a way that it would leave them alone – but that didn’t heed the panic in the eyes of the escaping lizards, or in Bella’s own rapidly-moving legs.

Trees came and went as the Defenders fled like a herd of sheep. They moved with no destination in mind, only the will to not burn alive. Bella had been sprinting for long past her lung capacity, fear eating away at her senses, before she remembered Millie. She glanced back, but the hole that led to the barracks was too far away to see now. ''Where is she? Should I look for her?''

But it was a hopeless thought. It had made her subconsciously slow down, and now Defenders of all sizes and colors rushed past her without a second thought. There was no way she’d be able to find her friend when the flames were still chasing them away. All she could do was keep running and hope for the best, because any other option would lead her to a scorching end.

Then something else caught her eye. Another lizard circling beneath the vast branches of a tree at the very edge of the clump of woods, far in the distance. Julie’s fire was pushing the Defenders straight toward them, but still they moved free of alarm until they saw the Defenders right behind them.

The shape dashed off into the surrounding trees. All of the Defenders – now led by Haylee, although they had been too caught off guard to organize themselves at first – proceeded, heading for the tree, as if they hadn’t even seen it. But Bella had. It was definitely a lizard, and though the shadows beneath the empty trees’ outstretched branches made it hard to tell, its form was occasionally dappled by claws of moonlight like tiger stripes, revealing scales that were gold… and green.

Bella stopped short, nearly tripping over herself. Defenders who had been running at the tail end of the group now passed her, their waving tails thumping into her back, but she hardly noticed. The lizard peeked over his shoulder to check if he was being followed, and that was the moment Bella’s green eyes met his own.

A teal gaze struck with horror, exactly what she expected, and yet the last thing she thought she would see on a night that seemed like it would have ended like any other. But she wasn’t curled up in her flat nest underground, head filled with dreams about living any life but her own. She was standing still, in the middle of a forest, with a smoldering purple blaze steps away from consuming her whole, staring at the lizard who she had last seen standing over her and demanding that she stay in the fortress, stay loyal to the phantoms.

And then, without a pause to so much as think about it, she was pelting after him.

==Chapter Twenty-Six - Visit - Bella’s POV==
The burning of the grass grew further and further behind Bella as she veered off her path to follow Dragon. The green-and-gold lizard didn’t move. He just stared at her.

Bella stopped just short of kicking him in the eye with her flailing claws. “Dragon,” she panted. Her mind felt blank; she had no idea what to say. She couldn’t ask if he was okay, because she had no idea what he would answer. She couldn’t say she missed him, because… well, she didn’t even know how to feel about that. She couldn’t ask what he was doing here, because clearly if Julie was around, then he was probably busy being a pawn in one of her conniving plans.

''Wait.''

“Dragon…” Bella’s hoarse voice cracked.

Without waiting another second, Dragon spun on his tail and darted deeper into the woods, weaving past tree trunks and over bramble-laced hedges while Bella followed him again, her face battered by branches and thorns.

There wasn’t enough air in Bella’s lungs to try talking to him again. Maybe, she thought as the tall grass sliced at her sides, that had been the case ever since she fled the fortress.

She didn’t need to, though. Dragon stopped short, having reached a stream too big to jump across, and Bella sped right into his back, sending both of them tumbling back a few paces. When Dragon tried to back up, his yellow tail-tip hit a solid mass of oak wood and, breathless, he gave up trying to leave and just sat there while Bella pushed herself up off the ground.

The sight made her eyes burn with momentary annoyance. Not because he wasn’t helping her up, but because he didn’t keep running out of thinking she wouldn’t – or couldn’t – hurt him. ''I could,'' she thought darkly. ''He’s got nowhere to run. I wonder how painful that assumption would be if I slammed him into the tree or held him under the water.''

But she knew in her heart what she wanted wasn’t really to hurt him. With her current state of mind, she didn’t think she could even summon her wings if she wanted to. ''My phantom tentacle wings. Would he laugh if he saw me with them anyway? Would he say the world’s trying to tell me that the phantoms will always haunt me no matter how far I run?''

“Please,” she managed. “Don’t go away.”

Dragon was silent for a few beats. “I can’t talk to you, Bella.”

“Why?”

“Because you’re ''one of them.''”

She didn’t know what to say to that. Ever since she gained her wings in front of Audrey and Marlenka, watching the others soar about the treetops without a care in the world while it was like her nightmares were attached to her back, she had never felt ''less'' like one of the Defenders.

“I can’t talk to you right now,” said Dragon. This was the most conflicted she’d ever seen him, Bella thought. “You… I have to go. I need to be somewhere else. Go back to the Defenders.”

He was about to turn back around and run over to where he’d been before, but then he paused. “And… please avoid the tree with the hole in the center of the trunk. There’s a trap.” Dragon dashed off through the leaves and was gone.

Bella stared after him for some time. Then his words hit her: ''There’s a trap.''

Instantly she started forward again, trying to remember where she had come from so that she could find the Defenders. They were still clustered together and not very hard to find, with Julie and her screen of fire burning ever brighter and chasing them still. Up ahead was just the tree Dragon had warned her about: a big yawning hole, too large to be a squirrel nest, was dented into its trunk over the height of the lizards’ heads. And the ground at its roots was leafier than most other spots in the forest.

Bella waited for the Defenders to start turning towards it, herded that way by the blaze at their tails, and then she rushed up to Haylee, who was in the lead with Marlenka and Audrey close behind her. The white leaf mark on her forehead was gleaming in distress.

“Haylee,” Bella gasped. “You have to stop running. There’s a trap in front of that tree. Tell the Defenders to scatter so that they don’t get trapped between it and the fire."

Haylee glanced between the leaf pile and the purple lizard uncertainly. “It’s really not a good idea to spread out right now,” she replied. “Some of us are going to get lost, and then we’re even easier targets if we’re separated-”

“''Please!''” yelped Bella. “Don’t go into that trap!”

Haylee opened her mouth, but it was too late. Her claws got caught on a twig and she was pulled down, gaping, into the leaves, which Bella realized had been covering a pit. Audrey nearly tumbled down right after her, but Marlenka grabbed her by the scarf and blocked the way with her large body to keep anyone else from falling in.

At last, Julie’s fire burned out behind the Defenders. The oddly-colored phantom soared over their heads, a purple-and-gold lizard sneering down at them atop her head, and tugged at a vine cluster by the trap. Haylee, entangled in a net composed of even more vines, was dragged up out of it; Bella saw she was trying to use her alpha powers to control the vines and escape, but every time she focused her magic on them, they just grew thicker and thornier.

“I’ll see you all at the phantom fortress,” Julie addressed the Defenders, her infuriatingly triumphant voice leveled out like the blade of a knife, “if you want to ''witness'' your great leader get ripped to pieces.”

Deeper in the woods, a flash of emerald green and golden-yellow became hidden behind a clump of berry bushes. Julie and the lizard on her head snickered at the shocked lizards and then carried their netted prize out of sight where they were hidden fast in the night.

==Chapter Twenty-Seven - Never - Bella’s POV==
The only time Bella had seen the lizards as silent and still as they were when they stood behind her, fresh off the sight of a trapped Haylee getting lifted into the sky, was when Audrey and Marlenka had first received their alpha powers.

A shadow swallowed Bella’s figure.

“You want to tell us how you knew that trap was going to be there?” growled Marlenka, her voice lower than the unmoving grass.

Bella turned around slowly. She thought she would just edit the truth, explain that she saw Dragon and cornered him, at which point he let that secret slip out, but the second she saw Marlenka’s bright red eyes boring into her own and the white sun that embellished her forehead blazing as bright as Julie’s fire, all her words and all her thoughts were swallowed in an instant.

She realized Marlenka’s huge arms were shaking with fury. “Get out,” Marlenka snarled. When Bella still didn’t move, pinned to the earth by that ruby gaze of disgust mixed with mistrust, the red-and-gold lizard swung her forearm at Bella with full force and sent the purple lizard sprawling against the tree’s trunk. When she hit the wood, splinters of it peeling off as she dropped to the earth, it hurt like she’d been thrown against the wall of the phantom fortress itself.

“Get ''out!''” Marlenka roared at her. “You’re no Defender, you sorry excuse for a spy. You had better go sniveling back to the phantoms and tell them all about how we’re coming to break their ulnas or else we’re doing it ourselves. ''Never'' come back or I swear I’ll break your skull.”

Bella felt like she couldn’t move. If Marlenka had bounded up to her and followed through with her threat right there, she wouldn’t even have rolled out of the way. When she looked up at Audrey, the purple-and-silver lizard was staring down at her with tears in her eyes. No wind was present to blow the ends of Mira’s scarf into the air.

At last Bella stood up. She heard Marlenka’s claws crunch in the grass like she was about to spring forward, but Audrey held her back with a light grip on the bigger lizard’s shoulder.

It wasn’t until she’d been walking through the oak-laden path for several minutes, her brain devoid of all senses, that Bella began to cry.

She hardly even registered when Dragon leapt out from an overhead branch and began walking beside her. Everything that had happened to her that night felt like it could only have occurred in a fitful nightmare.

Some more time passed and nothing seemed to change with Bella’s mental state. She was now vaguely aware of Dragon next to her. He was saying something to her, but she couldn’t wrap her mind around what until she saw the round, tentacled shape of Julie hovering just above the nearest tree. The sight of the purple-eyed phantom nearly made Bella have a full-on blackout right then and there.

“...You’ll join us, right?” Bella heard Dragon say. It sounded like someone had turned right the knob that controlled his voice’s volume, and at last she could hear him clearly, though her sense of understanding was still out of her grasp.

Hanging from Julie’s lower tentacles was a net made of chunky vines; there wasn’t much space between them, but in those thin spots where the other side of the net was visible, there was no mistaking the pastel blue and pink of Haylee’s scales.

“Brought a friend, did you?” Julie narrowed her eye down at Bella. The lizard couldn’t remember a time they had ever crossed paths back at the phantom fortress, but her true fear of the phantom was entirely fueled by listening to Dragon tell her how he, Julie, and another lizard named Skip spent their days after the partnership, wondering what kind of fiend could have made him believe he was doing the right thing.

“This is Bella,” said Dragon. “She was a Defender, but she… she was trying to sabotage them, but one of their leaders found out and now she’s all on her own. She’s completely dedicated to the phantom cause.” He tried to nudge Bella’s shoulder blade – make her look more dignified or conscious at a minimum – but the other lizard’s eyes were as vacant as they had been before, and pointed at the ground.

Julie’s grin grew. “That’s no saboteur. Oh, Dragon, I’ve seen – and ''overseen'' – far too many spies to be fooled by a fake one. This scrap of scales and claws can hardly stand up; no true phantom ally would be so weak after just running for a while.”

“Wait,” Dragon blurted, his voice panicked. “She ''is'' a spy. She’s just… she’s just…”

“How about this.” Julie floated closer to the ground. The viny net in her grasp hit the grass hard, but the lizard inside it didn’t make a sound. Her expression was just as smug as it had been when she captured the Defenders’ leader. “Why don’t we just ''keep her safe'' in the fortress prison, and then we can question her later to figure out if she’s really a spy.”

Once again she lifted into the air. On the top of her head, Skip squealed with glee at her speed. “Wouldn’t want her to get beaten up if the others were to find her all alone.”

It was the last thing Bella heard before the trees turned into giant shadows in her vision, blotting out the starlight and diving straight for her wide-open eyes.

==Chapter Twenty-Eight - Spirit - Audrey’s POV==
Audrey couldn’t catch a wink of sleep. In Haylee’s absence, Marlenka had led the Defenders back to the bunker, determining Julie no longer an immediate threat to the safety of the group. She was answered by any number of groans, tired faces, and uncertain looks, but after what she’d just done to Bella, no one was in the mood to question her.

The harrowing sound of Bella hitting the tree kept Audrey wide awake every time she tried to close her eyes. She was surprised the purple lizard had been able to get up after less than a minute, much less at all.

But Marlenka had been right all along. Hadn’t she? Audrey had willed Bella with her eyes to say something, anything, that would excuse the fact she somehow knew about the trap. She hadn’t, and now Audrey didn’t know if they’d ever see each other again.

''I wanted so badly to believe in her. To believe Marlenka was wrong.'' Audrey lifted her head to check on Marlenka. The red-and-gold lizard lay with her back to the sky, face hidden between her massive claws, with her eyes closed and her sides rattling heavily, but she didn’t look any more asleep than Audrey felt.

''It was a mistake to act like I knew better than her. She’s been one of the heads of the Defenders for three years, for Mira’s sake.''

If she couldn’t sleep, Audrey decided she would at least shut her eyes and pretend. Her brain kept the boredom of the silent night away by imagining places where Bella could be in that moment and thinking up a dozen different reasons Bella could have known about the trap. She was convinced by none of them.


The rustling of leaves – and the soft yet unmistakable noise of a jingle bell – led Audrey to open her eyes again. All the Defenders remained asleep, but unlike when she had lay down, everywhere as far as her eyes could see was blanketed in a foot of snow, and more flecks of it still swirled down from the silver sky.

Everywhere except for the patch of grass directly underneath Audrey. She stood up and held back a gasp upon being face to face with a giant teal and dark-gold lizard. The large creature, the edges of its appearance flecked with snow and appearing slightly transparent against the trees, laughed heartily at Audrey’s reaction; the sound of it boomed into the open air, but no Defender stirred.

“Have- have we met?” Audrey asked the other lizard, not knowing what one was ideally supposed to say when faced with such a situation.

“Well, I would wager that I know more of your life than you mine,” the giant lizard said, wiping at one eye with a massive grin on her face. “My… ''years'' of spectating experience have shown me that scrolls don’t necessarily keep track of the little details so well.”

Audrey squinted up at her. Was this someone she could recognize? At first she had missed the light-teal Jamaaliday hat the lizard was wearing, since it nearly blended in with both her scales and the sky, but once she saw it there was no mistaking who she was speaking to. “You’re Baylee,” Audrey realized aloud. “The… the protector of lizards from the fairytales.”

“''And'' visitor of lizard heroes,” Baylee added boredly, waving her claws around in the air. “Although you seem like the modest type, I could see why you wouldn’t have mentioned such a title for yourself aloud. Glad you haven’t been having any trouble mixing me up with any of the other ‘aylee’s around this camp, though. We are ''very'' different.”

Audrey blinked. “You’re, uh… not quite what I would’ve expected for the first lizard alpha ever. The benevolent spirit of the Jamaalidays, I think some of them call you.”

Baylee puffed out her chest and the golden bell at the end of her hat swung like a pendulum. “Well, I sure hope you’re not expecting an apology. The Jamaalidays are a time about spirit, and you know I’m a spirit that’s all about the Jamaalidays.”

“You only visit lizard heroes, though?” Subconsciously, Audrey reached up for the moon alpha mark on her forehead, even though it wasn’t something she could feel apart from her scales. Her mind went to the fairytale lizards that Baylee was said to have visited: great warriors with spears strapped to their backs and a glint of adventure in their eyes. “Except for that minor skirmish in Mt. Shiveer, I haven’t done any fighting. I haven’t even been able to puzzle out where a book from the Defenders’ storage came from. A ''book''.”

“Ohhh, you mean this little thing.” Baylee tilted her palm up to the sky and ''Secret Talents of the Lizards'' floated into it, not big enough to take up the entire surface. “I see you’ve all been ''very'' curious over the last couple weeks. If that’s still so, I was the one who put it there. Dang, that dusty ol’ shelf was just too perfect a place to keep it hidden.”

Audrey gaped at her. “''You'' left it there? How? Why? Did you write it? Why didn’t you say anything before?”

“Hey, hey, hold on a minute. Yes, I put it there. Slipped right into the camp no problem; long as there’s an opening, spirits can get in just fine, y’know.” Baylee tilted her head. “I did not write it. A friend of mine did – well, a friend who was alive back before I was-”

The snow whisked itself off the ground and whirled around her claws and head in fierce tempestuous rings, blowing the point of her hat in all the directions at once like a flag in a windstorm. “-''the Protector of Lizards!''” Baylee, eyes glowing white, let Audrey stare in awe for a short while before letting the snow settle back down on the ground and leave it as perfectly even as it had been before.

“Anyways. So he’s long gone, but he died before his research on lizard magic could get out into the world, so I did him a little posthumous favor once I foresaw that there would be lizard alphas once again.”

“So why didn’t you say anything before?” Audrey asked.

“I’ve got this little spirit contract, you see. I guess that’s what I’d call it.” Baylee arched her long light-teal and dark-gold neck down toward Audrey, close enough that the smaller lizard could see the voids that were her white eyes. “Before I could get a message through to you, you had to ''become'' a hero.”

Audrey glanced back at the Defenders. Remarkably, nothing had changed about the scene since the spirit first appeared – nobody was awake to be watching, a hundred chests falling and rising alongside one another just as before. “I’ll be honest, Baylee. I don’t really know if I ''am'' a hero. I couldn’t have been more confused when Mira told me I was supposed to be the new moon alpha. And when I was fighting those lizards in Mt. Shiveer, it just felt like… she made the wrong choice. Are you planning to visit Marlenka too? Because she’s been doing such an amazing job teaching everyone how to fight and battling off the phantoms while I’m at the edge of the group hiding with the hatchlings.”

At those words, Baylee snorted. “Oh, young lizard, Mira never makes the wrong choice. She likes Marlenka because of how much she cares about teaching the others how to defend themselves regardless of their age, and also how deeply she believes in the Defenders’ cause in general and has a good heart that wants to protect them. But I’m not here to visit her.”

Snow blew itself off the icy surface of the land again. Audrey watched, mesmerized, as it formed a breeze that split itself – one half drifted over to Baylee’s back, and the other half to Audrey’s, both of them forming an amorphous pair of wings that changed shape with every chilly breath of the world. “Above all things, cheesy and stale as it sounds, I’m here to remind you to believe in yourself. You’ve spent so much time wondering what it means to be the moon alpha that you haven’t been able to realize why Mira chose you in the first place.”

Audrey’s amethyst eyes sparkled with the light of dawn as she looked upon the spectral lizard. Gradually her light-teal body became a moving blur of snow just like the wing shapes on her back, and the golden-brown of the scales on her face blurred with the pale sky. “You don’t need to be busting phantoms left and right to measure up as an alpha,” Baylee continued. Then she winked, the image of her claws fading into the earth “After all, not all heroes are fighters. Some of them are defenders.”

Then the shape of both pairs of wings collapsed, dusting the ground where they had once hovered, and Baylee was gone.

==Chapter Twenty-Nine - Faith - Audrey’s POV==
Audrey heard when the gatherers began to stir. Opening one eye, she realized she had gotten sleep after all – or at least she felt like it, her legs free of the ache they had hosted the previous night. ''I can’t believe I was just visited by the first-ever lizard alpha.'' All the things Baylee had said still rang through her mind. ''I hope she was real.''

When Audrey lifted her head she saw Kaylee, expression blank. ''I admire how well she’s able to handle Haylee being captured,'' Audrey thought. ''Plus they’re sisters, too. Bella was just a friend I thought I made and yet I can’t move my thoughts anywhere else from where she might be.''

Kaylee glanced around the camp, then slipped away with her gatherer’s satchel swung over her shoulder. Now Marlenka really did appear to be catching some z’s; a snore rattled through the nostril she wasn’t covering with her claws. Audrey had reluctantly accepted that she’d need to prod the bigger lizard to wake her up, but then Marlenka got up on her own as if Audrey just standing there had shaken her from her sleep.

“What,” Marlenka grumbled.

“Can we go deeper in the woods to talk?” Audrey angled her tail towards a ring of trees a short ways past where the Defenders were sleeping.

Marlenka turned her head and surveyed the camp. Her eyes were narrowed – whether from the early morning sunlight or annoyance, Audrey couldn’t tell. “Are the gatherers out yet?”

“Kaylee left, but I haven’t seen anyone else go yet.”

“Hrng. Okay. I’ll grab Eira and have her keep watch.”

Over under a bending oak, so silent that Audrey hadn’t even noticed he was up until then, Raimu was studying ''Secret Talents of the Lizards'', most of its pages flipped to the left side. “Why not Raimu? He’s already awake, it looks like.”

Marlenka didn’t turn around. “He’s been acting weird. Like, half-awake weird all the time. Just take my word for it, okay? Good.”

Once Eira had been set to keep watch over the camp in the two alphas’ absences, they found a pebbly forest path that led to somewhere out of the Defenders’ earshot, somewhere near the burned-away grasses that had been decimated by Julie’s fire the previous night. “Looks like it’ll snow,” Marlenka commented awkwardly, glancing momentarily up at the sky without moving her head.

“I need us to lead the Defenders in a rescue mission together,” Audrey stated.

“Fine by me. How many are we sending to look for Haylee while the others handle the guards and all that stuff?”

Audrey lifted her head. “Haylee ''and'' Bella. This isn’t an attempt to get only one of them back.”

Marlenka lashed her tail in the grass. “Why don’t you ''trust'' me ever? Haylee wasn’t there, so I ''had'' to take matters into my own claws. I don’t care what Haylee ever thought about that one, I ''knew'' Bella was the spy, and I eliminated a huge threat to us by throwing her out. If she goes back to the phantoms and tells them we’re coming, good. If she dies trying, fine.”

“How can you talk like that about someone?” Audrey couldn’t help but louden her voice. This didn’t feel like her at all – just a few weeks ago she was hiding under a blanket on Loafie’s back so that she wouldn’t even need to catch a glimpse of the phantoms swarming overhead – but someone needed to stand up to Marlenka. “You hardly even let her speak before you threw her against that tree. She was ''scared.'' And don’t forget that by telling us there was a trap there, she was trying to save us! Without her warning, I don’t know how many more would’ve been captured.”

Marlenka pushed out her lip thoughtfully. “Audrey, look. I’ve been in the Defenders for as long as Bella has and longer. I have seen ''everything'' – the way she clings to that old healer Millie, the way she takes advantage of Haylee’s excessive ‘kindness’ and reluctance to admit that, yeah, there are evil lizards out there. Which is ''mildly'' important to know when you manage a group of them that has risen to become the fortress’s public enemy number one. But you know what you and I ''both'' saw? Her wings. Tell me you don’t forget the moment she got her wings.”

It was hard for Audrey’s mind to deny that Marlenka made a good point. Even she herself was still confounded at how closely Bella’s wings seemed to resemble phantom tentacles, which was a question that had mostly been pushed out of her brain. ''We’re not talking about that, though. This is about the trap and her exile.''

Audrey couldn’t let herself look away. Marlenka wasn’t a phantom feeding off of her fear as sustenance. She was a lizard, with a heart and a mind and the ability to respond to reason. “If Bella was really a traitor, she’d have said nothing when Haylee was about to fall into the trap. You were listening too. She was desperate for someone to listen to her; it was Haylee who dismissed the warning and got herself into the trap. Which is no fault of hers, but it isn’t Bella’s fault either.”

She remembered how Marlenka had instantly leapt forward and used her body like a wall against any other Defenders who might not have been able to slow down in time. A headache still radiated outwards from the moon on her forehead from when she thudded into Marlenka’s side. It was painful, but not more than it would have been if she’d tumbled into the net and got carried off ''with'' Haylee.

“Um… thanks for blocking off the pit so none of us would fall in it, by the way,” said Audrey.

Marlenka nodded curtly. “Look, I do what I can to protect the Defenders.”

“I know you do,” Audrey reassured her. “So please. We’re going to be there looking to bail Haylee out anyway-”

“And the alphas,” Marlenka cut in.

Audrey shuddered. “And my- and our owners.” For a moment she was just silent, praying to Mira that Loafie and Panda were still alive. She’d never seen Panda, Toxic and Cakepop’s owner, but the way both of them talked about him he was just as beloved by them. “We have to look for Bella just in case. There’s no real way to help us know whether she’s a spy or not right now, not before we can sit her down and ask her how she knew that trap was there. And she has to be alive and well for that to happen.”

Marlenka blinked. It was completely quiet for an uncomfortable number of seconds before she spoke again. “Fine. But we wake them up now, because the rest of the Defenders have had hours to sleep and we can’t leave Haylee to marinate in the phantom prison.”

“And Bella,” Audrey reminded her. “If she’s there. I hope she’s not, no matter the reason, but still.”

The red-and-gold lizard snorted, but she wasn’t frowning. “And Bella.”

==Chapter Thirty - Fading - Halo’s POV==
Just like the last night, Halo was shaken awake. “Up you come,” Marlenka said in his face. Her eyes met those of several other Defenders who were blinking their slumber away. “We’re going on an expedition.” She came over to the side of the grassy bank and rolled Big Bird over onto his back with her huge claws. “All of us together. Wake up, little soldier boy.”

“Thought he could soar,” Big Bird mumbled in protest, but he heaved himself to his claws and then shook himself out like a wet dog.

“We’ve got just one detour to make, and then we’re headed straight for the phantom fortress.” Halo was surprised to see Audrey making the announcement, her head high and alpha mark pulsing between her temples. “First we go back to the bunker and uncover our boomseed stores and blankets, as many as we can carry. There’s a party leaving right now of Defenders who want to retrieve them, so if you want to hop along, go ahead.”

''Blankets?'' Halo realized no one had any blankets with them, but he couldn’t recall why. ''Wait… why aren’t we sleeping in the bunker? What’s going on?''

“I’ll go,” Halo offered, raising his cream-and-teal tail in the air, although he still didn’t understand why the things he needed to bring back weren’t already here.

Audrey smiled when she saw him and nodded. “Thanks, Halo. See you when you get back.” Halo’s state of mind was too capricious to respond as he turned around and followed the group of Defenders back to the Jamaa Township barracks.

Several boomseed stores had been left covered in the earth, but looking between the shoulders of the crowd of lizards he was surrounded by as he returned to camp, Halo was surprised there were that many to get. He trotted along, looking for Vatra so that they could be side by side when it was time to advance on the phantoms, with a white blanket on his back; it felt familiar, but his brain couldn’t tell him why.

Marlenka and Audrey were sharing uncertain glances as they prepared the Defenders to march. Not many lizards were talking, but the ones who were sounded sleep-deprived and sad. “I hope we’ll be able to free Haylee,” murmured one to their friend. “I haven’t been able to free my owner Happy in the time that we’ve been here.” The friend was quick to agree.

Given the look on Marlenka’s face, she had heard the comment. She commanded the Defenders to silence themselves and remain still in the pre-march position they were currently in. “Everyone,” she began, pacing slowly up and down the line. “I get that it’s been a while since we last raided the phantom fortress… uh, yeah, it’s been two years, I’d say that’s a while. But the reason we haven’t been able to return yet is because we weren’t able to make up the power that was lost after that first attack, since a good portion of them resigned or just ran away.

“The fortress can be scary, alright? They’re always making changes and assigning guards in all these places so that no one can get in. But remember what you’re fighting for.” Marlenka stopped at the head of the line. “We’re not just besieging the castle for Haylee alone. It’s for her ''and'' the alphas ''and'' your owners, for those of you that had them. We’re launching an attack because we finally possess enough alpha power to have a realistic chance at getting inside those most closely guarded prisons.”

She looked at Audrey, and the purple lizard stepped forward. “And on top of that, more than having most of the alphas with us, we have ''you''. You care about freeing the real alphas so that Jamaa can have its most trusted leaders again, and you care about helping your owners get out of the clutches of the phantoms, who have been doing who knows what with them. You have passion and a want for a better world, and those are drives that no phantom can ever match!”

The Defenders cheered. Beside Halo, Vatra was silent and expressionless. Halo himself only registered the cheers with a clouded sense of hearing, stumbling as the row of lizards behind him moved forward and bumped into him. “Sorry,” he muttered absentmindedly, then moved his legs robotically forward in time with his comrades.

Vaguely he could hear some of them singing or chatting with one another as they went. Halo’s vision seemed to fluctuate; it felt like he was looking at where he was going from very far away, his perspective clouded with thick inky blots. At some point a migraine took hold of his head and burrowed deep roots into all reaches of his brain, so far down it felt like the pain bit the nerves in his claws and tail, too.

The landscape only darkened as the Defenders continued to march. The bright scales on Halo’s back already felt numb while white fell softly on the land. Ahead, Marlenka and Audrey still marched as lively as ever; on Audrey’s back was Wooyoung, who looked to be practicing his dual-elemental magic on anything he could pluck out of the snow on the ground.

Toxic was up near the front, too – there was no mistaking his black and highlighter-colored scales. Halo couldn’t remember anything else about him, though. Was he supposed to feel something about this lizard? As quickly as he’d spotted Toxic, though, the other Defender sped out of his brain as his headache pulsed like a strobe light.

By the time the Defenders stopped, Halo couldn’t even look at anything but the snow directly underneath him, its whiteness toned down by his own shadow. Anything else was too bright, including the rectangular flash of purple he managed to sneak a split-second glance at. It felt like someone had covered his ears with cotton balls and was driving a rough diamond through his head at the same time, but he did everything possible to keep standing.

Then the Defenders went on again with their march and the snow underfoot melted into patchy grass beside a path made of unsmoothed purple bricks, and Halo gave in to his fleeting ability to remain balanced before letting his vision be devoured by the pressing darkness.

==Chapter Thirty-One - Treason - Dragon’s POV==
Haylee didn’t say one word when Julie threw her into the prison cell. “And I’ll have some of my guards put on ''you'', leaf-face,” the phantom snickered, then slammed the barred door back into place. “Don’t try anything. We need you not dead so that you can partake in the most highly-anticipated fight in the entire fortress.”

She chuckled to herself and began to float away. Skip still rode along on her head and Dragon was about to follow behind them, but then Haylee did speak: “Will you at least tell me how I’m going to die?”

Julie squinted back at the pastel lizard. “Hmmmm, nah. But I ''will'' tell you that originally the general was going to have you fight your cute, fluffy little owner Kenzie, but the king liked the idea that ''I'' had in store much better. You’ll see when you see, ‘Defender.’”

Off again she went down the nearest spiral staircase, muttering about all the things she wished she could do to General Lido while Skip tittered his support. Dragon pulled his leg back from the doorway to the stairs. “I’m getting the guards off their shift, okay?” he shouted after Julie. She gave him no response, only a descending cackle that echoed up to the room with Haylee’s cell.

Haylee looked at Dragon curiously, but he wasn’t here for her. He raced up a separate staircase on the other end of the room, growling at a few phantom guards on his way to assure them he wasn’t a soft Defender. The fortress was a complicated labyrinth of prisons and empty rooms with craggy indigo walls, but there was a special set of cells reserved specifically for traitors, and he knew Julie would make the cruel joke of throwing Bella in there even though she knew he was lying.

Most of the cells were empty, the doors pushed aside or sealed off entirely. In one of the vacant ones there was an illustration of a phantom made on tattered yellow paper taped to the back – drawn in scrawl, yet given the helmet on its head, clearly the image of General Lido gripping the bars. Dragon guessed he never came down here to realize Julie was making a fool of him in every place possible.

“Bella,” he called out, and saw her at the end of the hallway. Her back was folded against the corner of the wall and a spider ran over her shoulder, but her bloodshot green eyes never so much as glanced its way. Her once-white sclera looked like they had been spit on by a container of strawberry jam.

“I’m sorry I lied to Julie,” he told her with all the honesty he could express. “I was trying to keep you safe.”

Bella lifted her head. “From what?” she whispered.

“Julie, the Defenders, I don’t know. I thought if I could convince her you were definitely on our side-”

“Why would you do that?”

“Because I don’t want to see you get hurt, Bella. I still wish you didn’t just leave on a whim like that.”

With some effort, Bella stood up, revealing the bruises on her elbows. “And ''I'' still wish you had nothing to do with Julie in the first place. You had that choice, and…”

“I see the mistake I made now,” Dragon said quietly. “But I don’t know how I’m going to fix that right this second. What matters most to me is that you don’t have to suffer with the Defenders.”

“I ''wanted'' to join them.” Bella’s voice cracked and she blinked away tears. “The phantoms can’t take Jamaa for their own under any circumstances. When I saw the Defenders at that battle… I know they lost, but they were so close to ''not'' losing. Why wouldn’t I have waited so long for the right moment to get out of this night terror of a home when all the gossip up until that point was about an all-lizard army whose power posed a real threat to the phantoms’ hold?”

Dragon stared at her, not knowing what to say. The two years that had passed since Bella’s escape felt too long and too short at the same time, but the hurt he had felt after she left had only exponentially worsened nonetheless.

“But it was all for nothing,” Bella went on, curling up into a ball again. Dragon suppressed a gasp at the much larger bruise on her back that was revealed. “They threw me out. I have nowhere that I can go.”

Dragon tilted his head. “They all threw you out? How did you stay there for two years if you had nobody?”

“Just one of the leaders. I didn’t have ''nobody'', I had… I had a friend who was a healer, and the leader who got captured was trying to protect me from- from the one who hurt me. And the moon alpha spent a lot of time training with me and making sure I was-”

“Moon alpha?”

Bella stared at him with shrunken pupils. “I… you didn’t hear that.”

“Oh, I did!” The light in the doorway was blotted out by the floating shape of Julie, a growling Skip clinging to her head. “Now, I don’t know what a moon alpha is, but I ''do'' know what an alpha is. And the ones ''we’re'' keeping have been very quiet and limited in their escape attempts. I figured there was something going on.”

The phantom shook her head at Dragon. “Well, I’m pretty disappointed in you. Good thing we’re already in the traitor prison, though, that’s a neat little convenience! Shame you’ll have to be locked up for the big battle… looks like those Defenders wanted to watch their scrawny little queen get shredded up after all.”

Dragon looked frantically at Bella. She stayed still and silent, mouthing to him: ''let them.'' With almost no time and fewer options, the green-and-gold lizard let Julie kick him into the nearest stall and snap the doors shut in his face.

“Got places to be,” she called behind herself as she headed back for the doorway. “Be good while I’m away.”

Both lizards were silent for almost a minute after she left, but Julie didn’t return. “They won’t send guards to watch you right now,” Bella said. “If the Defenders are really here, then the newest prisoners are bound to be the least of their concerns.”

Dragon grinned even though he knew she couldn’t see it from her own cell. “I like where you’re heading.”

“Thank Mira that phantom locks are unique. I still remember how to open one… you do too, right?”

He did. Phantom locks were one of the most common toys for fortress-born lizards, since they weren’t allowed to leave the fortress unless commanded to accompany a phantom party – and there was nothing else for them to play with. No one had ever bothered to stop lizards who spent their time solving them because it was just assumed they’d stay loyal to their tentacled keepers and never be on the wrong side of the bars. ''Well, I guess they were wrong. Maybe Bella can teach me more ways to prove it.''

Both of them were out of their cells in moments. “Where to now?” Dragon asked. He wasn’t used to taking the lead, having been conditioned to follow Julie’s orders at all times, but more than that, Bella looked to have a gleam of newfound confidence in her reddened eyes.

“I think that’s obvious,” she said. “We go meet the Defenders.”

==Chapter Thirty-Two - Fallen - Bella’s POV==
The two lizards raced down the stairs, the sound of exploding boomseeds spiking up the walls. “You tell me where to go and I’ll… I’ll do my best with the Defenders,” said Bella.

Dragon always hated how often he had been confined to the prisons, making sure nobody tried squeezing their way out as if there weren’t an entire command of half-asleep guards doing that already. But now thanks to that experience, he told her, he already knew every twist and turn it took to return to the throne of the phantom king.

Lizards and phantom guards were everywhere. The millisecond that Bella and Dragon had descended far enough down the stairs to get a clear view of what was going on, Bella had to yank Dragon back before an air-sailing boomseed could strike him in the eye. “They’re here all right,” he gasped.

“Stay here while I find Marlenka,” she ordered him with an authority rivaled only by the night she fled the fortress two years before. Her voice still quavered a bit, and her head remained down between her shoulders, but she saw trust in his nod and didn’t hesitate to leap off of the stairwell the second Dragon was out of sight again.

''Come on. Stand here any longer and you’ll be a pile of Bella dust.'' The purple lizard shifted her claws on the stair, her chest pushed forward like she was about to leap off. But her wings weren’t coming. ''Come on, come on, come on. It would be just my luck that my phantom wings fail me in the most important room of the phantom fortress, wouldn’t it?''

She thought of the moment she broke free of the lock. ''I thought I’d forget how to do it, but I didn’t. Julie underestimated me. And now it’s about to bite her where it hurts.'' Wings spread out from her back. Not to her surprise, they still carried the resemblance of phantom tentacles, but she refused to whine over that. There was a more crucial task she had to invest her focus in.

Bella dived down and landed in front of Marlenka, who jumped at her sudden and unannounced appearance. “Send at least two Defenders up the stairs right there,” Bella ordered, pointing to the same stairwell where she hoped Dragon was still hiding. “There’s no time to explain, but my friend is waiting up there and he knows the way to Haylee’s prison and how to get her out. He needs backup in case there are guards protecting her. As soon as you can!”

She took off again so as to avoid questioning from the red-and-gold lizard, and she noticed Marlenka glaring after her with uncertainty as she circled near the throne room ceiling – however, she had clearly learned to take Bella’s urgency seriously and soon yelled for Toxic and Cakepop to go to the stairs. Bella’s heart thumped in her chest. ''It’s working!''

The Defenders still held their own with as much power as before, but the phantoms seemed to be losing energy. In one corner of the room, Banana and Big Bird were fighting back to back against a ring of proto-phantoms that closed in on them. “Do the air thing, Biggie!” shouted Banana.

The brighter yellow lizard reared up on his claws and sucked in a huge breath of air before spitting it out in screaming song horrible enough to blast away their enemies. “Bang bang, SEAT OF MY CAAAAAR!!!!!!” No one dared challenge Big Bird after that.

Audrey was initially a struggle to find amid the capricious colorful chaos, but Bella found her at the very entrance arch from the outside of the fortress into the king’s own throne room where the battle took place. The purple lizard was in her winged form – scarf, eyes, and crescent-shaped alpha mark glowing like Mira herself – fending off a small group of armored phantoms from three lizards who were crumpled behind her. With a jolt Bella recognized them: Raimu, the stand-in tech alpha; Vatra, a gatherer; and Halo, Audrey’s friend.

“Audrey!” Bella crashed through the line of phantoms that harassed her friend, sending several bat-shaped phantoms with wings sprawling onto the purple brick floor. “What’s going on? They’re alive, right?”

A shout carried itself from the interior of the throne room to the archway. The phantoms facing Audrey that hadn’t been knocked away floated in the opposite direction in a hurry like they were being summoned, leaving Audrey to wearily land on the floor again and fold her silvery wings.

“I don’t know,” Audrey rasped. “They’re breathing… ''ever'' so slightly. I tried taking Halo’s pulse and I don’t know much about medical business, but I’m pretty sure it’s slower than it’s supposed to be.”

Bella looked the three lizards over, then held up Halo’s wrist to check his pulse and realized she was right. This was something Millie had taught her. “They just fell down like this?”

“When we arrived at the phantom fortress, the Defenders who were marching in their rows said they just collapsed. Vatra and Halo blacked out right here, next to each other, but Raimu was further back. I had to move him up here so that they’d be easier to protect.”

By now most of the phantoms stood behind their general – the same purple-helmeted phantom who had chased the Defenders out of their Sarepia Forest home weeks ago. ''That’s definitely General Lido. But… why aren’t any of his troops fighting?''

In another minute, every last one of the phantoms were clustered behind General Lido, eyeing the Defenders with wary gazes that traveled around the massive room and dared them to attack. The Defenders just blinked at them in confusion with no clue what to expect from the phantoms’ sudden withdrawal from the battle.

“Leach,” said General Lido, his deep and weathered voice seeming to make the fortress rumble. “Complete the circuit.”

An eight-tentacled phantom shoved his way through the crowd. “Yes sir.” His voice was a giggly growl, hideous fangs visible beneath his determined eye. Leach raised his tentacles and let his cocky expression slip into a stony mask of concentration.

Halo twitched. Audrey leaped back, startled by the sudden movement, before Raimu and Vatra began twitching as well. All three of the inert lizards’ eyelids fluttered and limbs spasmed for a few seconds, Audrey and Bella slowly backing away from the arch, until each of them stood on their own, no longer helplessly scattered in the snow. Hissing like zombies they formed a short row, Raimu in the middle with a non-alpha at either side of him.

When the tech alpha opened his eyes, they were blaring purple.

==Chapter Thirty-Three - Free - Dragon’s POV==
Dragon couldn’t stay still while he crouched just above the phantom stairs. So many times a boomseed would crash close to the wall or a lizard’s cry would split the air and he had to restrain himself from checking to see if Bella was still okay. Not to mention he had no idea whether there were any guards behind him or not and, racked with paranoia, he kept glancing between the base of the stairs and the shadow-cloaked corridor behind his tail.

It took several minutes before anyone came, but once they did, Dragon couldn’t be more relieved. A hatchling, her scales like the colors of a strawberry donut, popped into view, followed soon after by a bigger black and neon-yellow lizard who hurried her up the stairs. “Quick, Cakepop, we can’t have anyone wonder why we’re staring!” the black lizard whispered loudly enough for anyone in a ten-foot radius to hear.

The two lizards clambered up the stairs and Dragon made room for them so that they could reach the top. Both were winded once they finally reached the flat ground of the hallway, heaving hard enough Dragon feared they might spit up a few of their higher-located organs.

“Hi!” said the bigger lizard with a grin. He extended his claws for Dragon to shake before remembering the situation he was in. “Oh, right. Sorry, sometimes I forget we’re in the midst of fighting a big bad army of octopus ghosts. My name’s Toxic, and this is Cakepop!”

“Friend and/or adopted sister,” Cakepop announced proudly. “Marlenka said we’re here to free Haylee, where’s she at?”

Dragon had mapped out the path from the stairwell to the room with the cell that contained the Defenders’ leader in his head. “Oh, uh, Dragon,” he introduced himself when he realized he’d been staring in silence. “I’m retracing the path right now. Follow me, it’s down this hall and then we need to make a right. No, left. I ''came'' from the right…”

What he could appreciate most was that the two lizards never audibly doubted him. The smaller one didn’t ''particularly'' take care to be light on her claws as she navigated the twists and turns of the prison wing, but otherwise they silently let Dragon lead, taking in the drab, repeating purpleness of the fortress halls without so much as a mumble.

“She should be right up here.” Dragon once again exhaled with relief once he recognized the spiral staircase that Skip and Julie had guffawed their way down earlier. Haylee’s cell was unguarded – but still very much secured. The leaf mark on the pastel lizard’s forehead flickered dimly in the absence of light.

“Toxic? Cakepop?” Her head lifted instantly once she recognized her friends’ scales. “Are- are the Defenders still fighting?”

Cakepop bounded up to the cell and smushed her claws against the bars. “Mhm! Everybody looks so cool zipping around with their wings and using their elemental powers! I’m kinda shocked no one’s had a head-first collision yet, they were moving so fast.”

“And they won’t as long as ''you’re'' not there,” Toxic teased her. Even Haylee in her worn-down state, dark bags under her eyes from lack of sleep since being dumped in this dark, untouched corner of the fortress, couldn’t help but chuckle.

Dragon stood back awkwardly until Toxic took a hurried step back. “Whoops, don’t let us get in the way of you working your magic, bro,” Toxic told him. He was about to pull Cakepop back when she didn’t move, but within his next blink the hatchling had summoned her tiny ice-colored wings and was doing loops in the air just above her friend’s reach.

Meanwhile, Dragon was hunched over the phantom lock, rotating it back and forth as he worked through the symbols. “I wish I could’ve gotten out on my own,” Haylee admitted. “That’d have been a lot more dignified. But this cell… it must be enchanted somehow. None of my alpha powers are working as long as I’m inside of it, so I can’t even, like, rip a vine through the ground to bust through the bars and make an exit that way.”

At last the lock clicked and the bars slid aside. Haylee stepped out – carefully at first, then surely once she was all the way out. “Thank you.” She looked Dragon in the eye and showed him her graciousness in a more earnest way than Julie ever had. He thought of all the distasteful things he’d done for the phantom that she had hardly even muttered a scrap of appreciation for. “I don’t know if I would ever have stopped worrying about my friends if I’d been stuck in here until the phantoms let me out for this big battle they’re supposed to be planning, if you know anything about that. What’s your name?”

Dragon’s heart rolled into his stomach. He knew exactly the battle Haylee was talking about – Julie’s own idea to punish and humiliate her in front of the entire ranks of the Defenders. He couldn’t decide whether it would be more horrible for her to find out who she’d be fighting now or once she inevitably returned to the scene of the battle, so he just skipped over her mention of it entirely. “My name’s Dragon. I used to work for the phantom who trapped you in here, but… I’m not with that alliance anymore. Also, I’m a friend of Bella’s.”

Haylee gasped. “I hope Bella’s still alright. I’m definitely going back to fight if there’s still fighting left to do, so if she’s doing fine then I owe her an apology. I should’ve listened to her when she warned me about the trap.”

“Now that you’re free, it doesn’t even ''matter'' that you got trapped,” said Cakepop. “I wanna see when you use your cool leafy magic on those icky-wicky phantoms! Please please?”

“Audrey and Marlenka did a great job leading us here on their own,” Toxic informed Haylee. “No one can replace you, of course, but it wasn’t total chaos heading out here is what I mean to say. Although, uh… three of them kinda sorta… passed out when we reached the fortress.”

Before Haylee could exclaim her concern, Cakepop whizzed past her face. “We’ll explain after,” she growled. A shimmer of diamond-colored sparkles rained down impatiently from her back. “Dragon, do you still remember the way out?”

Dragon nodded and dashed down the stairs, determined to waste no time. ''So Haylee’s an alpha… even though the real ones are still alive, I think. Maybe she’ll use her powers to win the battle before she even needs to humiliate herself with the one-on-one fight Julie’s laid out for her.''

When he reached the final stairwell descending into the throne room, the Defenders behind him suddenly thudded into his tail. “Eek! Hey, why’d we stop?” Cakepop squeaked. Dragon couldn’t even answer her.

Toxic tiptoed over to his side to spectate the battle before Dragon’s party just charged in, and he too stopped and pulled himself back out of sight.

“What? What is it?” Haylee sputtered.

“Raimu,” Toxic whispered. “And Vatra, and Halo. They were barely breathing outside when we left, b-but-”

Dragon shook his head in disbelief. “They’re being possessed by the phantoms.”

==Chapter Thirty-Four - Magic - Audrey's POV==
With the speed of molasses dripping down ice, Raimu, Vatra, and Halo – all three of their eyes wide and purple and as vacuous as a bottomless well – advanced toward Audrey and Bella. The sense of conflict in the two lizards’ eyes was clear enough from their disturbed expressions and the ambivalent tension with which they backed away.

''How am I supposed to fight them if they jump out at us?'' Audrey knew she wouldn’t hesitate to keep Bella from harm if the creatures attacked, but what if by fighting back she hurt the real lizards whose bodies were being controlled?

She couldn’t rip her eyes off of Halo. The teal-and-cream lizard looked no less eager to rip her to shreds at any sudden move than the other two, but seeing her friend completely submitted to the phantom Leach’s will destroyed her inside more than anything else ever had, except perhaps for witnessing Loafie get ripped away before her eyes. ''I couldn’t fight him. I could run… but then he would just attack someone else.''

Even the phantoms seemed to be holding their breath. In the corner of her eye Audrey saw the base of a stairwell that hosted Toxic, Cakepop, and- ''Haylee’s alive!'' Audrey couldn’t keep her tail from lashing with pure relief when she saw the pastel lizard safe and unharmed. The purple-eyed Raimu snapped his head toward her with a snarl.

“Pin them down!” Marlenka bellowed. The Defenders acted with speed, surging forward and attempting to dive onto the backs of their mind-controlled companions. But the three phantomized lizards weren’t fooled. Just as fast, they spun and trampled over whoever they could, lashing out with uncoordinated but dangerous movements of their sharpened claws. In seconds, several of the Defenders had scratches on their faces, yet none of them were able to push Halo, Vatra, or Raimu to the ground.

Haylee sprung to action. She leapt from the air, the feathers of her pale-blue angel wings splayed out, and waved her wrist around in the air with practiced movement. The brick floor of the throne room rumbled and Haylee landed at the joint where the stairs met the wall. There, Audrey stood in front of her with silver wings unfolded and guarded the other lizard with her wings while she focused her alpha magic on the ground.

Both of their alpha marks were a furiously bright white now. A patch of bricks in front of them jolted in the ground like they were about to come loose, quivering more and more violently as Haylee glared at it with increasing intensity. At last, a thick green vine burst through the bricks and wrapped around Halo, who squirmed and screamed in its grip.

“Don’t hurt him!” Audrey yelped.

Haylee shook her head. “No thorns. I just need to hold him still for a bit.”

Soon the vine was joined by half a dozen lookalike friends. The original one, the thickest of them, dropped Halo, while the others weaved themselves into a dome shape that trapped the lizard underneath. Its sides budged every now and then as he tried to escape, but the vines didn’t let him through.

“Forget that one,” General Lido growled to Leach, the phantom who was controlling the phantomized lizards. “Focus on the others.”

Vatra and Raimu seemed to move with greater acuity after the command was given. The green dome didn’t have big enough openings for Audrey to peek inside and catch a glance of Halo’s bright scales, but once the vines stopped moving, she guessed he returned to his former state of unconsciousness now that Leach no longer maneuvered his brain. ''Unconscious is much, much better than dead,'' Audrey thought to herself, although it was impossible for her to confirm he was even that with or without a clear view of her friend.

Cakepop shouted to distract Vatra, who whipped her head around to try and catch the source of the noise. While Vatra was off her guard Marlenka lunged forward and pushed her spine into the ground, where the orange lizard could only wriggle under the unbearable weight.

“Oh, please can we ''take care'' of her?” Cakepop snickered. Behind and beside her stood a faction of hatchlings her size, practically populous and mischievous-looking enough to be an army of their own.

Marlenka grinned at them with a sharp set of teeth and stepped off of Vatra’s back, keeping one arm on the nape of the lizard’s neck. Before she could try and get out from beneath the larger lizard’s grip, the hatchlings piled on and held her there while Marlenka lifted her arm. They hissed things like “Stay down!” and “One more move and I’ll give you swimmer’s ear!” until Vatra gave up trying to escape their hold at last.

Audrey was surprised to see the timid Wooyoung among the group, although he wasn’t quite partaking in the jeering. Light as a raindrop he scampered off of Vatra’s back and up to her pinned snout, then sprinkled his claws over her head. Microscopic globes of water appeared, dripping down tiny floating mint leaves that hovered between his arms, and landed just between her furious amethyst eyes. “Fight another day,” Wooyoung whispered. “Sleep now.”

When Vatra’s eyes fluttered closed and she appeared to do just that, Audrey couldn’t be prouder of him. She’d have gone over and congratulated him on his proficient use of magic, had one more phantomized lizard not still posed a threat to anyone who moved quickly.

Now Eira was in motion. The star on her forehead blazed like a true inhabitant of the night sky. Audrey had wondered what Eira’s powers as the magic alpha would look like when she used them – and now that curiosity was satiated as she watched waves of lavender and pink sparkles coalesce into a great orb from the other lizard’s claws.

Raimu leapt at Eira, his tongue hanging like a flag from the side of his mouth between two rows of pointed fangs, but she didn’t even slow down. Without pressing her claws to the shimmering sphere directly, she thrust her arms forward and the orb passed through him, encompassing him like a bubble so that he never landed. Snarl as he did, there was nothing he could do to break free of it.

“Stop,” General Lido murmured to Leach. The lesser phantom nodded hastily and just like that, Raimu’s eyes rolled back in his head and he collapsed inside the magic sphere.

The general cleared his throat and stepped forward on his seven tentacles. “Lizards.” He grumbled it like the name of a plague. “You are awaited by a destructive end. We are able to access the mind of this… ''replacement'' alpha-” He gestured toward where Raimu lay unmoving behind the sheen of Eira’s magic. “-and unleash his power for ourselves, a type that is unfathomable to your kind, to escape this hold and effectively explode all of you in the process. We are well aware it could cause great destruction to this very throne room, but also that its use poses a much greater danger to your fragile scales.

“Produce your leader and allow her to face the opponent that has been chosen of her – if she wins, you all may go free, but if she loses, she will be the first of every single Defender to die in this hall.”

The contempt and plain annoyance in his voice was lost on no one; despite his threatening words, he sounded more like a disgruntled soldier than the great general who had led several raids on the Defenders’ barracks back in Jamaa. Haylee’s eyes were as narrowed as slits of winter sky, but she stepped forward without an ounce of hesitation syruping her limbs. Before she could nobly submit herself to Lido’s plans, however, someone else came forward first. Audrey looked on with a gaping jaw as Bella marched in front of the general.

“You’re lying,” she growled at him with more venom than Audrey would ever have thought lay dormant inside of her. “A phantom could never harness alpha power for himself, even through a lizard host. Alpha magic comes from an animal’s own spirit and goodness, and a phantom would be able to gain neither. You couldn’t use his powers if your life depended on it.”

General Lido just stared at her with a singular eye whose pupil couldn’t seem to rest in one place.

Bella jerked one forearm forward and watched the helmeted phantom flinch. “You’re going to let Haylee and the Defenders go free or else we’ll have to fight our way out.”

The moment she finished speaking, Bella’s claws were enveloped with purple and pink light. General Lido staggered backward with a gasp, bursting into a puddle of shadow-colored sludge at the sight of it, while as she was lifted up into the air by seemingly nothing – ''nothing'', Audrey realized, except the might of Mira herself.

==Chapter Thirty-Five - Love - Bella's POV==
Stars passed through Bella’s mind, brighter than those of the bubble where Raimu was held. She was rising off of the bricks on her own, General Lido’s helmet clattering to the floor atop the dark goopy puddle that used to be him, and her phantom tentacle wings unfolded from her sides.

Memories flashed through her mind. Recent memories, like freeing herself from the phantom prison and outwitting the phantom general’s scare tactic, but memories from longer ago as well: wrenching herself from Dragon’s grip and escaping the fortress, befriending Millie and Haylee and Audrey, flying for the first time and feeling like she could never touch the ground again and still be happier than she had ever been.

''My wings don’t resemble phantoms because I’ll never be able to escape them. It’s because I overcame them.''

Her wings were spread wider than before when she lowered to the ground after no amount of time that she could know. Otherwise, she didn’t feel any different – except for something between her temples.

A voice flashed behind Bella’s bright green eyes that she had last heard in Sarepia Forest after the Defenders’ last battle with the phantoms. She was able to discern the words ''phantom alpha'' before Mira’s projected presence faded entirely.

Dead silence had the entire throne room in a chokehold. It took about half a minute before Haylee emerged once again from behind Audrey’s silver angel wings and stopped in front of Bella. “Mira has chosen the final lizard alpha,” she announced. “And speaking of alphas…”

Haylee swiveled toward the remaining phantom troops, who were just as starstruck as the Defenders at what they had just witnessed. “You said an opponent’s been ‘chosen of me’? Don’t leave me hanging. I’ll fight him for the freedom of the alphas ''and'' our owners.”

The phantoms remained speechless, their twitching eyes still fixed on Bella, the very sight of whom had caused their general to bust, but it wasn’t quiet for much longer. A lizard bounded through the archway from the snow-laden grassland outside into the throne room and strolled to the head of the phantom ranks. Bella realized she hadn’t seen this lizard at all during the battle, even though she was part of the Defenders.

Even though she was the sister of its functional leader.

Kaylee nearly blended right in with the dark, rugged fortress walls, but there was no mistaking the leafy green of the scales on her face or the furious blue of her eyes when she stared Haylee right in the pale face.

“Concerned about everyone getting their owners back all of a sudden, are you?” Kaylee snapped, inches from her sister’s nose. “Three years of training, hiding, moving out, and doing ''nothing.'' And ''now'' you care about the happy reunions you can only ever emptily promise every Defender in this room?”

Haylee said nothing.

The purple-and-green lizard began to circle her. “You act like this group was some great big plan to get Kendall back.” Her voice broke when she mentioned the name. ''Is that her and Haylee’s owner?'' Bella wondered, not sure what to do. ''Would Haylee want help? What’s going to happen?''

“But you’ve been so stupid for the ''entire'' time she’s been gone. You never even ''questioned'' how I could’ve found out the phantoms were building more prisons in Mt. Shiveer. ‘Rumors?’ Seriously?” The level of Kaylee’s voice had risen to a shrill yell. Haylee’s eyes only watered as she continued.

“I have been ''so'' fed up with you. I gave the phantoms our new location every single time we got ‘discovered’ in the past year, and you ''still'' never bothered to figure out why we were moving every other week or whenever.” Kaylee stopped pacing in a circle and looked her sister directly in the eye. “I would say that at least you’ve got the spirit to be a leader, ignoring how you oh-so-humbly refuse to call yourself one, but you don’t even have ''that''. The Defenders are supposed to be all about getting Kendall back – and all of ''their'' owners, you would probably lie and say – but you won’t even try that for three. Whole. Years.”

Marlenka stomped her way through the Defenders, her lips drawn back in a deep growl, like she was about to do to Kaylee what she’d once done to Bella – but Haylee lifted her claws. “Marlenka, don’t.”

The pastel lizard wiped a tear from her eye and finally met Kaylee’s smoldering gaze. “That’s ''not'' what the Defenders are all about. They’re about keeping Jamaa safe, teaching armadillo lizards to protect themselves because now that their owners are captured or gone they need to be able to look after their own tails. When you think of warriors with the power to hold back a phantom invasion, we lizards were never first to come to mind. And part of why I founded the Defenders of Jamaa is because I wanted to change that. Lizards have so much power and heart within them, and when we come together-”

“Come together to do ''what?''” Kaylee sliced her claws across Haylee’s cheek.

Haylee let the beads of red roll down it. “To keep the phantoms out of the lands we love, and once we had enough power, rescue our owners. I didn’t know how soon we’d be strong enough to get there, not until Mira began granting alpha power to us.”

Kaylee barked in her face, “And if little white symbols from a bird in the sky ''didn’t'' fall into your lap one after another?”

Her sister held her stare. “There’s no way I can say when we’d have been able to launch a raid like this if the true alphas hadn’t been captured. But just because we fight doesn’t mean we charge in and get ourselves killed if we don’t have the right amount of strength. Trust me, I have never lost sight of Kendall or wanting to get her back-”

“If that’s so true, then fight me.” Kaylee flexed her dark-green claws. “Fight me with all the care you have for Kendall and we’ll see who really loves her more.”

Haylee shook her head stiffly, keeping it high. “No, Kaylee. I’ll fight phantoms if I have to, but I won’t fight you.”

“The phantoms were right,” sneered Kaylee. “You act like you’re all big and tough and in charge of these lizards, but since they captured Haylee you’ve only gotten softer. Kendall would hate you. She would cry if she saw you now.”

“I think Kendall would cry harder knowing how much she tried to keep us safe before the phantoms took her away, and now you want to tear us apart like we were never sisters,” Haylee replied quietly.

Kaylee didn’t respond, only blinked. Bella couldn’t be sure from how far away it was, but the green-and-purple lizard’s eyes were glistening.

“Why are you working for them?” Haylee whispered. “They’re starving our owner in a cage so that you’ll rip me to shreds. Why do you think they’d give her back if you did that?”

“That’s ''exactly'' what they’ve promised me, actually,” Kaylee shot back.

Her sister shook her head again. “You want to do that so that you can go home together, without me, in the middle of a war and live a happy, peaceful life free of phantom threat? You think when they’re tossing their ruthless patrols into Crystal Sands and they see Kendall’s den among all the others, they’re going to make an effort to spare it just because you made a deal with them months ago?”

Kaylee finally couldn’t hold up her bristling exterior and broke down in a series of sobs. Haylee put her claws on her sister’s shoulder comfortingly, but withdrew when Kaylee shook them off her shoulder. Wooyoung tilted his head toward Haylee, offering to come over, and she nodded.

“She loves us equally, Kay,” Haylee said to her. “And she wouldn’t want this. We’re going home together as soon as I can get us both out of here.”

While Wooyoung soothed Kaylee with the same magic he had used to subdue Vatra, who was still snoozing beneath the Defender hatchlings who were using her like a bench, Julie arrived from the direction of the prison stairs. Skip was still at her side, snarling as usual at everyone except himself and the phantom he worked mindlessly for. “I wouldn’t be so sure.”

==Chapter Thirty-Six - United - Audrey's POV==
“You’ve all been very annoying throughout this whole war,” Julie snapped. She scowled at the phantom general’s helmet, laying on the floor with no head to fill it. “But I’m pretty sure the final straw has to be killing Lido before I could get my tentacles on him myself.”

Her eye began to shimmer with a pale purple light. Audrey recognized it: she was about to use her fire. “Good thing you spared enough of his idiot supporters that a good show’s still possible… and I suppose that makes that nitwit’s figurehead position as the king’s right-hand phantom definitively mine now. As a courtesy I’ll kill you lizards later once I’m done turning every last one of them into mush.”

Julie splayed out her tentacles, waving them in the air, and enormous bursts of purple fire exploded from them. The throne room was engulfed in seconds, her colorful blaze burning away tapestries and phantom flags, and roaring up to block all of the exits. Audrey dived away from the corner she was in to dodge a flame that now blocked the stairs to the prisons; even if she had wanted to escape by going deeper into the fortress, she couldn’t. No one could, no matter which exit they attempted to take. Some of the phantoms from Lido’s army tried to frantically put out the fires by throwing their sludge on it, but anything of the sort only made them grow higher.

“Get Vatra away from the arch!” Haylee ordered the hatchlings.

As soon as she finished the sentence she coughed hard and stumbled on her claws, but Marlenka caught her side. “C’mon,” growled the red-and-gold lizard. “Urgh, stupid impulsive pyromaniac phantom. If only I could fight her fire with mine.”

Audrey’s eyes widened. “Maybe that wouldn’t help anything, but… I think I have an idea.”

Raimu, his eyes now back to normal, scrambled over to them. “I just woke up,” he gasped. “Did… did I miss anything important?”

Over in the back, vaguely recognizable among the sea of phantoms who all resembled each other, was Leach – clearly too panicked, and likely too traumatized, to try taking control of Raimu or the other two phantomized lizards again.

“Raimu,” Audrey addressed him. “Did the book say anything about what happens when the alphas combine their power?”

The older lizard appeared frustrated as he racked his mind. “I can’t remember much from that book at all, but… I think I once heard that if all six alphas focus their magic together, it can briefly create a force of pan-elemental purity.”

“Brief is all we need. You three stay here – I need to find Eira and Bella.”

Bella heard Audrey and dived down herself. “Don’t fly,” Bella advised her with a cough. “The smoke’s much worse up there. What do we need to do?”

Just as Audrey had finished explaining her plan to the other four alphas, Eira came over on her own and leapt right into Raimu’s arms. She kissed him on the head, right on his gear-shaped alpha mark, while he sobbed with relief into her shoulder. Audrey wished she could let them stay there like that for as long as they wanted, but Julie’s fire was growing and the smoke that came from it only thickened.

“I’m so sorry to interrupt you,” said Audrey.

Eira shook herself out. “No matter. There’s plenty of time for the two of us once we return home.”

The purple-and-silver lizard admired her confidence that they’d be able to escape for sure. “Alright. We need to summon as much power – alpha power – as possible, starting with you, Eira. So Eira makes an orb, a reasonable size to contain five other forces of magic inside, and then each of us contribute to it by using our own powers. Once there’s enough inside the orb, we can whirl it around the room, put out the fires, and take out Julie.”

“I doubt Julie’s fire is normal fire,” Raimu said, nodding in approval of Audrey’s plan. “Like all phantom magic, it’s a source that comes from pure hatred and sadness. Even if there was water within miles of this Mira-cursed fortress, a force of purity may be the only thing that can put it out. Luckily we don’t have to waste our time trying the former.”

He rose to his claws, unbalanced from what Audrey guessed was a mix of the thickening smoke and being the one in control of his own legs again. “Prepare yourselves,” Eira told the others through gritted teeth. From her extended palms, sparkles twinkled and grew larger, swirling with one another until it created an orb as large as any of the lizards’ heads.

Marlenka added her magic first. An orange beam shot out from her sun-shaped alpha mark, followed by a dark-blue beam from Bella’s mark, which Audrey realized resembled an eye now that she could see it up close. Raimu was nearly knocked to the floor again by a particularly nasty cough, but Audrey helped him get up and aim his golden wave of power while Eira was busy keeping the orb intact with her own sheer focus.

Then it was Audrey’s turn. Purple light – not pale and sickly like the color of Julie’s flame, but the bright courageous shade of Liza the panda alpha’s eyes – flashed out of her moon-shaped mark, adding a layer to the sloshing magic inside the sphere that looked like liquid tanzanite. Finally Haylee took her place in the semicircle of lizard alphas and let green glow out from her leaf mark, filling Eira’s sparkling bubble so that it almost looked like a rainbow marble made by Mira’s wings.

“I need all of your help in order to maneuver it around the throne room,” Eira said, her voice hoarse from inhaling the smoke. “Counterclockwise. Go!”

With the pure force of their minds, the six lizard alphas blasted the orb forward and swept it through Julie’s fires, each one dying instantly when touched by the magic. Audrey could only suppress a cheer as the fires dissipated one by one all throughout the room, the smoke generated by each one evaporating to clean air that flowed through her lungs and felt as rejuvenating as a breath of new life.

However, as it collected fire, the orb shrank and shrank. It just barely made it all the way through the throne room, disappearing into nothingness before it could even tap Julie where she stood in front of the throne.

“So you want me to turn ''your'' sorry scales to ashes too?” Julie screeched at them. Her deep angered frown shifted into an ugly grin. “Well, that’ll be just fine. Gosh, won’t the king be proud to get ''that'' as a little present for… what do you idiots call it? The Jamaally-days?”

The brick floor shuddered as violently as if a volcano had erupted right on top of it. The bowl-like shape of the phantom king, his head topped with spikes that ringed around him like a crown, appeared on the throne in a puff of darkness and narrowed his eye at Julie. “Try to destroy ''my'' throne room, did you?” he rumbled. “What a shame. You had such promise, Julie.”

“I did it to catch those vermin! And I have!” Julie, outraged, flailed one tentacle at the wide-eyed Defenders, who were very much not caught. “I brought the whole stupid group here, just like you asked of Lido’s entire army, but they never came back with ''any'', did they?”

“A disappointment from both of you. I should not be surprised.”

The phantom king slowly hovered higher in the air, sweeping his tentacles underneath himself before slowly extending them out again. Audrey watched as a circle of purple energy formed and intensified underneath him, but all she knew was she didn’t want to be inside of it. Julie forgot that she ''was'' within the circle’s bounds until the king slammed down in front of her.

Julie the phantom was dead.

==Chapter Thirty-Seven - Unshackled - Bella's POV==
Bella had seen the phantom king slam before. It was his signature tactic in combat, the famous move that decimated even the most courageous animals who ventured inside the phantom hives. Although he hadn’t fought any battles himself in quite a long time, Bella still imagined the receiving end of such a blow was not too painless.

Like he always did after slamming, the king became dizzy – but the second he realized where he was, vulnerable and in a room full of lizards that had just kicked his army’s behinds, he vanished in a swirling black plume. Now only Skip the lizard remained, quivering in the corner like a twig on a windy winter day.

Haylee stepped up to him once she was sure the king was gone. “Take us to the prisons and set the alphas and our owners free,” she ordered him.

“''Now'', you floppy fish,” Marlenka added with much less noble composure, “or we’ll break in there ourselves and feed your bones to Greely.”

Skip didn’t need to be told twice. Haylee ordered the Defenders to stay in the throne room while she, Marlenka, Bella, and Audrey ascended the prison wing until, at last, they arrived at what Bella identified as the highest cell on this side of the fortress: the miserable place where the alphas were being held.

Of the six cells in the room, all but one of them were full. There stood five of the alphas, covered in grime and pushed up against the bars to be as far away as possible – just a few feet, that is – from buckets of disgusting contents Bella didn’t dare take a peek at. When they saw the lizards their eyes went wide as individual moons; Peck nearly tripped over herself trying to get as close a view of them as possible, made worse by the purple ribbons tied around her hind paws.

“Uh, hi,” Audrey said awkwardly. “We’re here to rescue you… and stuff.”

“No way! Rescuers! OMG!!” Peck squealed. Her pink nose poked through the silver bars and sniffed at them. “Oh my wow, Mira and Zios heard us. GUYS! Mira and Zios ''heard'' us! Look at their foreheads!”

Self-conscious but sparing with words in the presence of five of Jamaa’s greatest heroes, Bella showed the others how to open the phantom locks while the former alphas marveled at their marks.

“Thank you.” Sir Gilbert nodded his heavy head once Audrey opened his lock. “Your courage will not be forgotten.”

Greely was more wary as he stepped out of his own cell. “Will we need to fight our way out?”

“We shouldn’t have to,” Haylee told him with a shake of her head. “It’s a long story, and if you want to hear it I’ll save it for when we’re all safe and out of here – but first, where’s Liza?”

As soon as he was free, Cosmo stretched and crawled over, his leaf skirt rumpled from weeks of endless sitting. “They kept her in a separate cell. She should be somewhere down there.” Then he grinned warmly at them. “Thanks for setting us free. Wow, lizard alphas! That’s gotta be the first time since… since…”

“Since Baylee,” Audrey volunteered. She smiled too.

Luckily, they didn’t have to go far to find Liza’s cell. The panda gasped lightly when she turned around, instantly locking eyes with Audrey, whose moon mark was only glowing brighter.

“Are you… the alphas?” Liza asked.

“Three of them,” explained Marlenka. “The others are resting or something, they’re alright. Ish.”

Audrey opened Liza’s lock. The bars growled against the stone mechanism as they were drawn aside, but otherwise all was silent. The two moon alphas simply stared at each other. Bella wondered if Audrey was sending messages to the panda alpha just by looking at her – there were so many words floating in her eyes when Bella turned to see them.

“I’m Audrey,” the lizard introduced herself. “I think… I think I’m supposed to be you. The moon alpha.”

A couple seconds later, Liza shook her head with a friendly look. “That can’t be right,” she said. “''I'' think you’re supposed to be Audrey the moon alpha.”

Audrey leapt at the panda in a hug, and Liza embraced her right back before setting the smaller creature back down on the prison floor. “Alright, everyone,” Haylee announced. “Let’s head on down before any more phantoms come as backup. Prepare yourselves, alphas… I don’t know if you’ve met many of the Defenders before, but they’ve been growing up with stories about you and idolizing you all their lives, so don’t be too surprised if they’re not all completely calm.”

About halfway back to the throne room, Graham stood up straighter suddenly. “Uh, guys? What’s gonna happen to our stuff that the phantoms confiscated?”

The other alphas stopped so suddenly they nearly started a domino chain. A few of them exchanged glances, and then Liza finally said, “Cameras are pretty replaceable.”

“Who says I only needed that specific paintbrush?” Peck shrugged.

“I can always just get another enchanted candle-and-horn staff forged with the magic of Mira herself,” Cosmo added happily. The others murmured their agreement.

Finally they were about to descend into the throne room when Haylee stood in their way. “Bella, would you and Dragon mind coming with me to handle the cells where they’re holding all of our owners?” She dropped her voice and gazed up apologetically at the six former alphas. “I’m… not totally sure I want to be there when the Defenders… erm, show you their gratitude.”

Audrey laughed, and the dying chatter of the Defenders in the next room finally went silent. “Don’t worry, Marlenka and I will handle them. There’s a whole story the alphas have got to hear, you know.”

“I didn’t agree to that,” Marlenka yelped. “Dibs on not being the one to take care of it if the hatchlings get out of hand. These muscles can only take so much, ya know.”

“I’ll come with you, Haylee. Dragon probably won’t mind, either; he’s not really the best in social situations. Especially with a hundred lizards who were prepared to kill him a day ago.” Bella poked her head out from the entrance to the throne room. Countless pairs of colorful eyes blinked back at her, but Dragon understood he was wanted and made his way over.

Then the alphas finally emerged from the stairwell, marveling at the wild sea of lizards who stared at them. Dragon, Bella, and Haylee managed to disappear just before the throne room erupted into a zoo.

==Chapter Thirty-Eight - Stars - Audrey's POV==
The Defenders were having the time of their lives washing in the streams near the Jamaa Township barracks, washing the clean water gray with all the grime their bodies had accumulated in the last day and a half. The river hadn’t frozen over yet, but a plunge into it was as shockingly icy as if it should’ve gone solid a month ago.

The six former alphas had decided to wait until they were in the safety and comfort of the bunker area to hear what had gone down. Audrey enjoyed hearing Halo and Raimu and Bella and Dragon cut in to add their own versions of the story or details that were taking place behind the scenes.

The former alphas were entertained, too – the first thing Peck and Cosmo did when returning to Jamaa Township after weeks in the phantom prison was run into Jam Mart Clothing and ask the deer at the drink station if they had any jumbo marshmallows for sale. Now they munched together as the sky began to flush pink and the steady snowfall eased into flurries being tossed between the trees.

Behind Audrey and Halo, who sat side by side, Loafie listened to the lizards telling their tales with a quiet sort of pride. By her were Panda and Kendall, whom she had come to befriend during their time locked up in the same cell, all of them taking in the fresh, snowy air of the town tinged with the smell of bonfire and letting it soothe their souls.

“I hardly have the words to describe how incredible I find your journey,” Sir Gilbert told the lizard alphas once the story had dissolved into separate chattering conversations. “You have proven something to a lot of us, Defenders of Jamaa. Perhaps you can be as mighty as a tiger trooper and no taller than its knee.”

“Yeah!” Peck bounded over the bonfire and landed in front of the lizards with an outstretched palm. “Little people power!!” They began smacking their claws against her paw all the way down the circle while a tiny orange flame gasped for air at the tip of her tail. ''Boy, do I miss normal fire,'' Audrey thought graciously.

Somewhere across from Audrey, the fire blurring the air and obscuring each other’s faces, Bella sat beside Dragon. Finally Audrey had recognized him as the lizard she tackled during the Mt. Shiveer mission, but after hearing everything that he – and Bella – had to say about himself, she believed that he had a good heart and could change. She knew he wanted to; before the Defenders had even left the fortress he had asked Haylee if he could join the group and learn to fight the lizard way.

Bella had also gotten a chance to explain herself.'' I’m glad that I never totally doubted her,'' Audrey thought to herself. ''She just wanted to see her friend again. And she saved us. It’s been tough trying to convince Marlenka to be open-minded and considerate when it comes to other lizards’ situations, but I can see that she wants to try that too.''

At some point, Bella got swept out of the rest of the conversation by Greely, who rested on his blue paws near her and Dragon and spoke to them in a hushed voice. Audrey couldn’t hear most of it, but the two lizards appeared to be at ease, and she heard the wolf ask more than one question about the phantoms and their fortress.

At last the sky was deep and speckled with glinting dots that were difficult to tell apart from the flakes that still whirled in the night breeze. Haylee was the one to ask the question that all of the Defenders had been thinking about since the former alphas had first been freed: “What happens now? Will Mira grant you your powers back?”

Liza glanced at Sir Gilbert glanced at Greely glanced at Peck glanced at Cosmo glanced at Graham. “Well, do you six ''want ''to give up your powers?” Liza asked.

“You guys have been really cool with them,” Graham added. “You, ah, know how to use them responsibly. Yes.”

“Mira ''clearly ''made the right choice!” Peck agreed with enthusiasm.

It was the lizard alphas’ turn to exchange glances. “Do you mean you no longer want your powers returned to you?” Eira asked Liza.

“I have fought alongside enough valiant animals – tigers, lizards, and otherwise – to know that you don’t need alpha power to protect Jamaa.” Sir Gilbert bowed his head before the lizards. “As long as I can continue doing what I love and leading the tiger troopers in battle, it does not matter to me.”

“I’d be able to focus more on my work,” Graham pointed out. “I’ve gotten a little bit of, ah, separation anxiety from not being able to work on my latest high-tech hat rack project.”

Greely gave a chuckle so deep it sounded more like the rumble of a volcano. “I was planning on resigning soon anyway.” Peck’s gasp was as dramatic as if someone had shoved a vacuum into her windpipe and sucked out every last molecule of the air inside it.

“We’d be happy to carry on the alpha responsibility with Mira’s approval,” Audrey said. Her verbena-colored eyes scanned the clearing and she couldn’t help but smile. “More than that. We’d be honored.”

She could’ve sworn that the bonfire at the heart of the gathered Defenders flickered, for just a splintered shard of a second, into a pair of heron wings.


When Kendall had offered to adopt Bella and Dragon, they couldn’t have been more ecstatic. Audrey had seen Dragon smile on a couple occasions once he sat by the bonfire with Bella, finally able to be warm and away from the phantoms for the first time in his whole life, but that next morning he was full-on grinning while Marlenka helped him summon his wings.

“We want to know what it’s like to be loved by an owner,” Bella explained to Audrey when she was giving the news. “And who better to live with than Haylee? Dragon also wants to learn healing magic, and Haylee happens to know some. He wants to be there to help Kaylee get better too.”

“That’s beyond amazing!” Audrey hugged her friend. The iridescent threads of Mira’s scarf brushed under her chin. “How ''is ''Kaylee?”

Wooyoung, who had been whizzing about the air so fast Audrey could hardly even see him before that moment, landed in front of her and pushed his nose into her arm. “She’s resting,” the small hatchling informed her in a muffled voice. “She said… she forgives Haylee. And Haylee forgives her too.”

“I hope she means it,” said Bella.

Audrey nodded and rested her head on Wooyoung’s. “Me too. She has the capacity to. I think the ability to forgive is inside everyone, even if it’s locked away. The key for each is just shaped differently.”


Audrey got the chance to apologize to Halo right before he went to sleep that night. “I should’ve paid more attention to you,” she said. “You’re my friend, Halo. I never meant to replace you.”

Halo sneezed and his cream tail-tip drifted off the top of his nose. “No, it’s okay, Audrey. I shouldn’t have acted like I was the only friend you were allowed to have.”

“I saw that you made a friend too. Vatra, right?”

“Yeah, Vatra! She’s really cool. Our first session hunting for leaves got a little… interrupted… but I think I wanna be a gatherer, and she wants to show me how.” Halo frowned. “Do we ''need ''gatherers anymore? Now that everyone’s owners are free, what’s gonna happen to the Defenders?”

A few paces away, the tunnel to the bunker was blushing gold with the artificial light coming from underneath. The ends of Audrey’s silvery scarf drifted toward it in the light breeze with the weight of feathers. “Well, a lot of the Defenders ''are ''gonna go home now that they’ve been reunited. But Haylee says the group’s got enough members to remain intact, and Kendall and some of the other owners want to stay as helpers and travel with the group.”

She glanced down at Halo. His red x-shaped eyes were just barely open. “Actually, Loafie wanted me to ask you in the morning since she was interested in staying too. Do ''you ''still want to be a Defender?”

Halo thought about it for a moment. Then his eyes fully closed. “If we can bring the pillows from home.”

Audrey snorted and curled up next to him. Even in near-sleep the moon mark on her forehead was softly glowing like the globe in the sky. Fields of dazzling stars twinkled overhead, watching the lizards sleep, the bustle of the next-door town ever slowing as she slipped into a peaceful slumber, dreaming about her feathered wings carrying her so high, so far into the open sky that the stars winked up at ''her''.

I never thouht i'd get all the way up to 15 thousand subscribers so quickly, and I have you and only you to thank! Thank you all so much for supporting me so that I can make viedos for you guys. It's so fun and I'm overjoyed that people actually enjoy my videos! 
btw it let me say "sexy" because of my noob editing skills B|

I tried including as many people from my den and around Jamaa as possible. Since it's you guys who got me this far, I thought it'd be great including you in this Music Video, and I think it turned out really well! It's one of my favorite songs too, and it won a voting thing on Facebook too

A few things had to be spelled wrong so it'd come through, sorry ^-^
I actually started this a few months ago, it took forever to edit 4:30 minutes of it xD

Have an awesome day you guys! And if you have any video suggestions, please let me know in the comments! :D

Leave a like if you enjoyed,  If you want to see more videos from me maybe give that subscribe button a click too, it would mean the world to me! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

'''Warning!: Blood, Gore, Physical (and possibly more than that °~°) Abuse'''

Inspired by Good VS Evil, Royalty and Experiment RPs!

==Blurb==
Precious has been stuck in the Phantom Kingdom’s Laboratories for months now, hoping someone could call the alphas for help…

Except ever since Greely resigned, the alphas are being pure stupid.

The Phantom King, Emperor Fang is trying to make Precious the next Phantom Queen, with some erm…sacrifices to make.

Who will win? Will Precious be free?

== Characters ==
Precious/Shanshuo

Ai

Chichi

==Chapter 1 Kidnapped by Phantoms==
June 203X

It’s been a while,

Precious was trapped here for ages already.

She was kidnapped, somehow,

by the phantoms she had found.

They have taken her to a lab,

filled with monstrosities she’s never seen.

She knocked on the cages,

screamed in pain.

The phantoms didn’t notice her a lot,

until one day.

The Phantom King,

came and looked at her in the eye.

”She shall be my queen.” He said.

”Make her like a phantom, please.”

And they did, injecting her with medicine.

She twisted and turned,

crying in pain.

The phantom’s venom is lurking,

within her blood.

Why did he chose her,

For this strange game?

== Chapter 2 War Refugees ==
October 202X

It was the War of the Phantoms,

The alphas aren’t doing well after Greely resigned recently,

animals are suffering from their injuries.

The phantoms too.

A young fox was looking for shelter in the midst of the war,

she had lost her entire family to it.

There she saw, a young phantom.

She didn’t scream, she didn’t run.

”You’re hurt.”

It raised its head.

”Don’t worry, I don’t meant any harm.”

She padded towards it.

They sat together,

by the fire the phantom made.


She remembered now,

he was the phantom she met,

Whom she had spared his life.

He is the King.

== Chapter 3 The Wedding ==
31 October 203X

What has that little phantom she met become?

An innocent to a heartless soul?

She thought as she continued to lie on her bed.

”Ai! Jade! Can you come here? I can’t find the dress!” One of the phantom maids squealed.

She looked up. Two more phantoms, one ghostly white and the other night blue.

”You sure Emperor Fang chose her? Why does she look…so different?”

”Same, perhaps he likes her? I don’t know!”

She was then forcefully pulled out of bed.

”C’mon! We have to make sure the bride dress fits! We’ve never seen anything…that’s not round and with tentacles!”

The moment she wore it, her vision went hazy.

The longer she spent in that gown, the more phantom-like she grew.

First her fur went from orange-brown to purple, then tentacles,

then…

she couldn’t even recognise herself from the mirror.


The wedding, it’s time.

”Emperor Fang, do you wish to take erm…” The priest halted, staring at her.

”Shanshuo, that will be her name in the Phantom Kingdom.”

”I shall call you husband and wife, you may now kiss the bride!”

She stepped back, ”I…don’t belong here…”

”…” The crowd went from cheering to silent.

”For years…I have been trying to convert you animals to phantoms, it all started from when I met you. I thought the only way to make peace is to make animals…like us…” He muttered out of the blue.

His gaze went sorrowful, Precious’s pity for him gave in.

And she went for a smack on the lips.

”I don’t care what you want from me, but all these years since we went part, I’ve still remembered you. Just please don’t leave me in a cage next time.”

And from then on, she became the Phantom Queen, Shanshuo.

== Log 1 ~School~ ==
January 2019

Dear Diary,

Hi, I am Miki, I don’t have much to say about myself,

but I do have a friend, Bates, who always help me with my stuff.

Oh did I mention Anna, his girlfriend, aka the start of my chaos?

My life has been tortured from start to end,

And I’ll tell you from the beginning,

I know, not everything is fine, but it’s not bad.

Don’t worry, I’ll see you later.

== Log 2 ~Wild~ ==
I woke up,

it’s a sunny Sunday,

Wait! why am I an artic fox???

I ran out of the den, someone is waiting.

From the star on his head, and the stuff I know,

he’s the alpha.

He told me to kill a pack, which is harming us.

Us? What do you mean?

He called me bird-brain for that.

Is there something wrong?

I later swapped places with another wolf.

What should I do to get in that pack the alpha told me to kill?

Massacre?

One by one?

Spy?

Oh yes! Spy! That should do it!

I offered to be in the pack of theirs.

And I was introduced to the alpha…

That’s it.

That was all I remembered.

== Log 3 ~School~ ==
Was this a dream?

All that haze?

I’m back at my chaotic school again.

But hey, ever since Bates left me, I got some new friends!

After meeting them at the lunch table near the trash, that is.

Summer, Jake, Iorek and Frosty.

I told them about my strange dream.

Iorek told me a legend in Jamaa:

Wolfchangers.

During the day, they’re fine. At night, they’re wolves, or foxes, sent to another place.

One problem, those worlds appears as dreams, but they can affect Jamaa, since the wolves also live there.

Maybe there’s more wolfchangers like me? I wonder if the dream is true or not.

Mom: Here you go.

(Wyn receives a milkshake, Elina has mouldy pizza.)

Birds: OH MY GOSSSSHHHHHH HIIIIIII-

Elina: But-

Mom: YOU’RE GROUNDED!

Elina: I’m already grounded for my entire life-

Mom: SIX MONTHS!

Elina: UGH! I HAVE THE SAME GRADES AS HER!!! WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH HIGH EXPECTATIONS ON ME?!?!

Mom: GET. TO. YOUR. ROOM. NOW!!!

Wynter: …don’t you think-

Mom: Don’t you talk to your lovely mom this way about your trashy sister!

Wynter: Eh, fine. Whatever.

Mom: You’ll have cake for dinner! And Elina will have biscuits, or she’ll be grounded again.

Elina: That’s what you call me every time! What do you expect? A Cinderella-type Mary Sue?

Mom: Go clean the chimneys! You dirty mouth! And darling, have this!

(Wynter receives a jewellery box, she peeks inside.)

Wynter: EEEEEEEE A DIAMOND NECKLACEEEEE!!!!

Mom: And you!

(Elina gets scraps of paper.)

Elina: You sure they’re books?

Mom: SHUT UP!!!

(Elina leaves again.)

Wynter: You sure I deserve all this, Mom? Eli is just the same as me and you-

Mom: What did I say about that trash can?!?!

Mom: (leaves server)

Wynter: …

Elina: Oh, you again. And you’re gonna call me “stupid big fat loner dummy stupidity dumb sister who does nothing at all”?

Wynter: That’s because Mom told me to.

Elina: WHAT?!

Wynter: It’s the birds or Mom’s fault, you’re my sister -and I would never do such a thing! You know I helped you at dinner!

Elina: (runs out of room and looks down the stairs for Mom) Oh, she left, good. I accept your apology, or else that wouldn’t make sense. For some reason I just have to be a Mary Sue, but just this once.</text>

''Based off the series The Neon Common by Mrs. Wolfy on Adopt Me!''

== Blurb ==
Enigma the grey tabby, unlike any of her owners’ pets, simply has no tier! Rainbow and Racer, the sugar glider and lizard duo are harassing her! Will Enigma find her powers and finally gain her own Jewel Tier?

(For the sake of convenience, pets have tiers according to their players’ exp, magic and such things, not by literally merging them-)

== Chapter 1 ==
“GUYS I GOT A NEW PETTT!!!”

A young bunny’s shriek echoed the room, she ran in, holding a tabby in her paws.

”Kids, this is Enigma, our youngest daughter’s first pet! Be nice to her, she is pretty shy!” A taller ladylike bunny hopped in.

The youngest bunny jumped in joy, Enigma in her arms. They put her on the floor with some kibbles before the rest of the family leaves the room.

”Eww! She’s a Non-Jewel!”

“Look at her! She has no glowing trail! No red, no green, nothing!”

”Jewel-less?! YUCK!”

The bunny heard that, “Be nice to my first pet! You’re only here because of my older siblings!”

”Yeah yeah, Hopkins. Can you leave us?” The sugar glider moaned.

The petite grey tabby slowly climbed herself up the beds for a nap. A lizard threw her off.

”Do we really need to have a Jewel-less on our fancy beds?!”

“I said no pushing!” The bunny picked the poor kitten up.

”Sorry!”

”Mama! Can we take them to the pool?”

”Of course!” The mother shouted in the living room.

At the pool, Enigma trembled, she never made a single sound other than that tiny screech from earlier.

A highland cow smirked, “Guys, I have something to show you! Cannonball-”

And SPLASH!

”ENI!!” Cried the bunny.

”Spike! What did I say about manners?!” The father was mad, “Hopsy dear! Let Dad get Enigma, stay here!”

The young rabbit didn’t notice, darting off immediately into the pool, scooping Enigma up. They’re all soaked.

“Mama! Did someone pushed her in there?”

Enigma went quiet.

”Surely she doesn’t know how to swim, dear. She seems like she wants to play with you in the pool, but don’t know how.” The mother looked at her, curling in her owner’s arms.

“We should go home for dinner now.” The father started packing.

At home, the bunny put Enigma on a brand-new bed, “Good night, buddy.”

Enigma is ready to shut her eyes too, but-

“Rainbow! Have you heard of the rainbow tier?”

”What?!”

”The pets with them have glows in all sorts of colours!”

“I wish I’m one of them, should be soon. I’m the eldest Emerald Tier in Jamaa as of now!”

“Same!”

The next morning, the bunny came in, squeezing Enigma tight. She ran to her room with the kitten in her arms, plopping her a comfy cushion.

”Stay here, I wanna show you something!”

She then ran back up, to the pet room. Her siblings are cleaning the food bowls.

”Mama’s holding a welcoming party for Eni! Can you help me with presents, sis?”

The lizard and the sugar glider growled, they don’t seem pleased.

”Gosh, they’re so mean to Eni!”

”Of course, Hops! It’s a tradition whenever we get a pet!”

“Guess we’re doing on our own!”

The youngest came back with Enigma, giving her a yarn ball. The three of the bunnies walk down with their mother watching news.

”Hops! Prance! Frolick! The alphas are having a conference about their new discovery: Rainbow Tiers!”

“Rainbow Tier?! Oh yes! That’s it!” The bunnies screamed, “Thanks mom!”

”Anything for a welcome present!”

The day of the party, the kids cheered for Enigma, the others though…aren’t really in the mood.

“Probably gonna be the worst party ever!”

”I know, right?”

The youngest picked Enigma up, and the family went on their car to the Lost Temple of Zios. Even though Enigma’s confused, she only purred in excitement for the party.

”Rainbow Tiers! Rainbow Tiers!” The three children chanted.

The Hall of Icons was a magical place, Enigma looked in wide eyes.

”You ready?” Asked the mother.

”Yes! Yes! Yes!” The youngest cried the loudest.

The magic began, the kitten now glowed in pink with a tint of white.

“BEST DAY EVERRR!!!” The kids squealed in joy.

Back at home, the bunnies showed her to the others. They were shocked.

”She’s…she’s a RAINBOW TIER?!?!”

The highland cow admitted, “I’m…sorry I pushed you by accident, I was showing off and I didn’t notice you-“

”It’s okay. I forgive you.” Enigma muttered her first words, “What’s your name?”

”Spike.” He replied.

“Enigma.” She added.

“Wanna go to the ball pit? I can teach you how to do cannonball!”

And they ran towards the room next to theirs.

”Hey I wanna be a Rainbow Tier! It’s no fair! Why is she treating a common creature that appears in shops way better than us, rarest pets of all?!?!”

“Hey, Racer! I have a plan!”

“What?”

”We’re taking that weenie down.”

== Chapter 2 ==
“Wow.”

“Yeah. I know, right?”

The duo giggled at the plan and let out a devilish grin.

Meanwhile, Spike and Enigma are playing at the ball pit.

“Can I get some water?”

“Sure!”

Enigma went to the kitchen and was looking for the water bowl when-

“Hey, Rainbow and I want to say sorry.”

“Yeah, we feel so bad for ourselves.”

“WHAT?! But they are meanies to me once!” Spike yelled.

“Not anymore. They’re really sorry!”

“Are not!”

“They are!”

“Are not!”

“I forgive you guys.”

“You’ll regret this in five minutes, I swear.”

“Prance is taking us for a bungee jump! You going?”

“YES!”

“Then what are we waiting for!” They all ran out of the house.

Coral Canyons.

“Wow, new clothes.” Enigma looked at Epic Wonder’s windows with wide eyes.

“Bungee jump, remember?” Rainbow shouted in annoyance.

They went up after Prance’s turn, who was told to wait at the souvenir shop.

“Now let me tie this rope.” Racer helped.

“Good, but I’m scared.”

“I can help if you’re scared.”

“Great idea.”

And Rainbow pushed, and watched as Enigma fell down and down.

“Now let’s scram before Prance sees this!” Rainbow whispered in Racer’s ear.

At the house, Hopping is worried. Enigma hasn’t been back for four hours straight.

“Have you seen Eni?”

“Nope, she went with Prance earlier.”

“Surely they’ll be back soon, it’s getting late.”

On the phone,

“Enigma! She’s missing, Mom!” Frolick called on the phone after listening to Hopping’s sobs.

“Oh dear! I’ll call the neighbours to ask if they’ve seen her.”

A treehouse near the playground in Jamaa Township.

“Where am I?”

“In a treehouse. Oh heavens, you’re alive!”

“Who are you?”

“Flash the squirrel at your service, my lady. HONEY!!! THE CAT IS AWAKE!!!”

“Oh thank goodness my bees saw you in time, or else you’ll be dead meat! I’m Honey by the way, and you…?” A Meagyn’s bear barged in the treehouse through a window.

“Enigma. Thanks for saving me.”

“I swear your owner could’ve tighten that knot of yours.”

“But she didn’t! Rainbow and Racer did!”

“THOSE TWO?!?! They keep teasing the non-member pets in the playground!”

“Well we have to do something!”

“But how?”

At the bunnies’ house,

“Mom! Pa! Eni’s gone!” Hopping bursted in tears once the rest of the family came back.

“I’m sure Racer and Rainbow are behind this! It’s not my fault, they took her after it’s my turn and told me to wait at the souvenir shop!” Prance insisted.

At Prance’s room.

“Rainbow! Racer!” Prance screamed.

“What is it?”

“Where. Is. Enigma?” Prance repeated.

“We don’t know, and neither do we care.” They rolled their eyes.

“That’s it, you meanies! You keep harassing our new pets all the time! Down the basement, shoo!” Prance shouted in anger.

“Come on, kids! We have to go find Eni!”

At the treehouse,

“I think I hear something.” Enigma’s ears flicked.

“Your owner?” Flash asked.

“Yes, let’s go down!”

“Eni! Where have you been? I’m so worried and scared!” Hopping hugged Enigma tight.

“I’ll tell you back home. Spike? I’m sorry, I should’ve listened.”

“It’s okay, glad you’re safe now.”

Back at home,

“Prance took us for bungee jumping. Rainbow and Racer didn’t pull the knot tight enough, but Honey and Flash saved me!” Enigma explained.

“Oh thank you guys so much. What’s you say about being Prancer’s new pets? She just kicked out Racer and Rainbow and they’re in the basement.”

“That.”

“Would.”

“Be.”

“So.”

“AWESOME!!”

“THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!” Flash and Honey cried in unison.

“But what about-“

“They’re on the basement, Mom’s taking them somewhere else, a hospital if I remember right.”

“Did I smell DINNER?!?!” Flash shrieked.</text>

'''A Note'''

''You never know when someone you love will pass away. And you may never get the chance to say goodbye.''

''And you may not be sure how to feel.''

''Know that it's okay to cry.'' 

''And love unconditionally.'' 

=== Part I - Frost ===



''"P- please, Mrs. Brooke. W- we haven't had anything to eat in w- weeks. We n-need food,"'' stammered a sickly fox.

''"You do not know what is wrong and what is right, child! I am the one who gives the orders around here!"'' snapped Mrs. Brooke, a heartless wolf.

''"Please... just one loaf of bread... We promise we won't bother you again... We're so hungry..."''  the fox implored, eyes overflowing with hope, with love. 

He truly believed that a being so far past redemption could feel empathy.

''"You are pathetic. You are useless. You have no right to ask me of anything!"''

A thin, wheezy rabbit murmured something softly into the ear of the youthful fox. The two exchanged a brief moment of peace, of hope. Mrs. Brooke was quick to interrupt them, her face having broken into a nearly psychotic grin.

''"You think you can fool me with your parlor tricks and your petty acting? You think your friendship will save you? Well, it won't! The world will take everything you have. Everything!''

''"And you cannot ask for anything back. You will only be neglected. Begging will only outcast you further, making you inferior.''

''"And once you have reached rock bottom, you will only fall more. Deeper into despair, into yearning, into hopelessness, into pain, into fury, into misery, into hatred.''

''"And that is what will destroy you in the end. Your love. Your desire.'' 

''"Everything that makes you human will make you a monster."''

Mrs. Brooke's voice cracked. A single tear trickled down her jaw.

Yet it was not enough for her to feel regret.

She towered over the shivering young fox, the very same pup that had dared to speak out. He pleaded and sobbed, desperate for mercy. The wolf arched her back, her eyes glittering with triumph.

Yet she was not satisfied: she unsheathed her claws, a greedy glint forming within her expression. She cackled maliciously as she scratched the child, again and again, yelling at him to count each time, to beg for her to stop, to swear he would never act out again. 

And through the night she scratched and scratched and scratched, cackling and cackling and cackling, as the innocent kit begged and begged and begged.

The light of the gibbous moon was not enough to acknowledge and balance the wolf's cruelty. Every morning, she rose again, only to scold and beat each child within her home of hopelessness. Every night, she terrorized the same pup and his rabbit friend.

Each child had no name, but in secret, they looked towards each other for support, for love.

And each of them had been awarded their own name.

Even in the face of violence and hate, they still believed that each and every one of them mattered, that each and every one of them should be protected and validated.

The first one to be named was the rabbit, and his name was Frost.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

''"It's alright, I don't need to sit by the fire,''" the rabbit offered shyly.

''"If Mrs. Brooke catches us..."'' whimpered an anxious otter.

''"We're going to be OK. Just get some rest, all of you. I'll be on lookout,"'' the rabbit answered reassuringly.

''"But you'll be cold! I don't want you to get sick!"'' protested the little fox. 

''"Don't worry. I'm used to the winter time,"'' the rabbit smiled wistfully. ''"I've been here the longest, but I can handle it. I'll keep you safe. You should be more worried about yourself than me."''

''"That's not fair. You can't tell me to stop worrying. You're my best friend,"'' the fox sniffed, doing his best to look brave and strong.

The rabbit shook his head. ''"I want to do this. I want to protect you. Like I said, the cold can't hurt me."''

''"But she will,"'' the fox whispered meakly.

''"Please,"'' he added, ''"don't do this."''

''"I'm sorry. I don't want anyone else taking the blame,"'' the rabbit replied stiffly, his gaze then drifting towards the motionless body of a tiger gone limp. ''"Not again."''

The brave rabbit turned away from his friend, and faced the steel bars of the dungeon they were forced to call home.

''"It wasn't your fault,"'' the fox murmured.

''"I won't let it happen again. I'm going to face the cold,"'' the rabbit insisted boldly.

He rose, straightening his posture. ''"I'm not afraid of it anymore."''

The fox was taken aback. He loved his friend dearly, and wished him nothing but safety and comfort. And yet, the world does not always work that way. 

And so, the fox did all he could. He gave the rabbit the world: a name. 

An identity. 

''"I believe in you, Frost."''

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Violet Brooke was not always cruel. Yet by the time Frost had been named, she had lost herself. In her own words, she had fallen past rock bottom, deeper into despair, into yearning, into hopelessness, into pain, into fury, into misery, into hatred.

She started her life plenty fortunate. Her family was not particularly wealthy, but they were at the very least happy. 

For a brief time. In the old days when Jake was still himself, carefree and humorous. When Sunny's smile lit up every room. When her parents were still together.

Her father was a clerk at Jam Mart Furniture. Her mother worked as one of several tailors in a small business. She had a younger sibling named Sunny, and an older brother named Jake. 

Jake was a senior in high school, and he made the first crack in the mirror.

On one side, you could see joy and laughter, excitement and passion, kindness and love. 

On the other, there was a void filled with pain. 

Jake had tested his parents many times. His father grew more and more impatient with him. His mother cried when she thought no one else was there.

His mother was crying because of Jake.

Jake snuck out of the house. Jake skipped school. Jake was failing all of his classes. Jake never asked for permission. Jake rarely showed up for dinner. Jake's best friend moved away. Jake wouldn't talk about his feelings. Jake trash-talked his parents and his teachers. Jake stopped playing with Sunny. Jake quit the football team.

Ever since third grade, he had wanted to play football. As an eight grader, he came to high school tryouts, and made varsity. 

He hadn't come out, but during his senior year, there were rumors that Jake had kissed a boy.

And the varsity football team was all boys.

And all of the boys didn't want a gay boy on their team.

So whenever he walked by, they shouted at him, whispered words in his ears, threw pencils and trash and food at him.

The captain of the team, Cameron, who had always been willing to do one-on-one practices with Jake, began to send him threats.

It started with texts telling him to keep his head down. Then notes in his lockers. Then the rumors.

Then Cameron got his other friends together and started chasing him. Every day, they chased him until he couldn't keep up, and they left him with a bloody nose and a hefty bruise.

So Jake got the message and quit football.

And soon enough, Jake quit everything else.

Then he started doing drugs.

And then one night, Jake came home for dinner. He had a bottle of beer and a knife.

He downed the whole thing in 10 minutes. He vomited all over the floor and laughed it off. Then he took the knife and thrust it down his chest.

Sunny was there the whole time, and she was terrified. But she grabbed the knife before it touched Jake and called for Violet.

Sunny was six years old.

That night, the mirror had cracked the first time.

And that night, everyone in the family was crying. 

But Sunny, Violet, and Jake had nowhere else to turn.

A week later, their mother was diagnosed with depression, and she had lost her job.

Their father stopped coming home for dinner, too. He had to work full shifts.

And every night, he came back more stressed, more exhausted, more annoyed.

Until one night, when he yelled and wouldn't stop yelling.

And Sunny heard it all.

But Sunny still smiled. Sunny still played. Sunny still dreamed. Sunny still tried.

So Violet lived for Sunny, because Sunny was the only person left in her family who still tried to live.

And Violet's father kept yelling. He yelled at his wife when she wouldn't get out of bed. 

But he wasn't encouraging her. He was destroying her.

He pushed her away.

When she was in a better position, she decided to move out. She founded her own business as a fashion designer and made a living by herself. A few months later, she filed for an official divorce. 

Her husband was devastated. He wrote mountains of letters and sent them all to her, begging for her to come back, apologizing for all his wrongdoings.

She never sent back.

She was happier without him.

Since he discovered this, he was determined to make things right for his children. 

He wanted to give them the happiness they deserved.

And so he got an office job. He worked long hours in the city and got more money for it. He spent thousands of diamonds on his children.

More toys for Sunny. Therapy and rehab for Jake. A garden and a book nook for Violet. 

And eventually, Jake got a little better. He quit drugs and spent more time with his sisters. 

But he still wouldn't touch a football, and he still got chased and bruised and called names. 

Jake's father thought he could buy each and every one of them happiness. So he worked for longer and longer, for more and more money.

But Jake got more and more stressed. He felt responsible for fixing his family. He felt terrible for what he put Violet and Sunny through. 

And each day, he struggled to not end his life, to give in to the voices that taunted him.

He kept talking to his therapist. His therapist said he needed other people to support him. He needed to keep pushing through. He needed to know he wasn't alone. He needed to make new friends and eat at family dinners.

Jake replied with the fact that his father stopped coming to family dinners.

And it was a problem Jake couldn't solve.

And so Violet tried to solve it. But she couldn't, either.

The only thing that held them together was Sunny.

Until one afternoon when Sunny didn't come home from school.

By then she was nine years old. She was still a phoenix, bright as ever, always energetic, always faithful, always optimistic, always passionate. 

She had a flame that never burned out.

Until her father received an email that there had been a school shooting.

Thirteen students had been killed.

He scrolled down the list.

''Austin Meyers. Leo Sanchez. Benji Takahashi. Claire Evans. Esperanza Basurto. Ruby Halls. Mack Taylor. Elias Fischer. Avery Campbell. Ailani Hale. Sam Lynch. Charlie Hansen. Sunny Brooke.''

He told Violet and Jake that Sunny was at a friend's house.

Violet and Jake found out in the morning when Sunny still wasn't back.

Violet yelled. Violet sobbed. 

Jake didn't know what to say.

Everyone was cracking.

Everyone was broken.

Then their father got laid off.

He told them it was a good thing. He'd make it one. 

Finally, they could spend time together. As a family.

But they ran out of money in a month. Jake and Violet didn't have jobs yet. 

Their father told them to stay inside. There, they would have shelter and meager insulation. They still had beds and furniture for comfort. He would try to find food for them.

When he came to the streets, he was denied. He held up a cardboard sign labelled ''please donate. anything helps.''

But no one helped.

He sat through the pounding rain and the booming thunder. 

He sat through the howling winds and the humid mists.

He sat through the beating sun and the flashing lightning.

He sat through the layers of frost withering him away.

Minutes turned to hours. Hours turned to days. Days turned to weeks. Weeks to turned to a month.

Still, no one helped.

He had lost his way home.

He starved to death shortly after.

Eventually, his grave was moved besides Sunny's.

At first, Violet visited them every day. 

Then Jake tried to start a new life. He moved away and applied to college. He got a job and got accepted as a student at Mira's Academy.

Violet was alone.

She never went to college. She never found a job. She didn't have any friends.

Instead, she stayed in her den and pretended she did.

She played with Sunny's toys.

She ran around with Jake's football.

She became the village psychopath.

One day, she decided to make the rumor true.

And that was the day she began working on her Orphanage.

And her Orphanage became a home of hopelessness.

It became a prison.

It became a torture chamber.

But she wouldn't stop, because she couldn't.

She had lost herself.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Frost stood in front of the fire, as he promised he would. He kept guard and was wary of each and every sound: the crackle of the campfire, each restless movement of the other  children, every single pawstep, even the sound of his own  breathing.

He did not breathe steadily. He knew his friend was right: If Mrs. Brooke caught him, he would be punished.

He was already hurt, though. And he knew it would hurt him more to see so many others in pain.

And he knew that if anything, he deserved it. He was not innocent.

Even if he may not have directly been responsible for the death of the tiger, he had at the very least contributed to it.

He remembered the day  as clearly as the sun shining in a cloudless sky.

A glimmer of hope. Tangible. Pink, green, blue, red, orange. Gems.

Gems meant food. Gems meant clothes. 

And that meant survival.

He scooped up the lot of them, a measly twenty-seven, the spare change of a single purchase. 

But those twenty-seven gems could be worth gold.

He told the tiger that he would get every single one for himself if he took the beating.

And the tiger accepted.

And the tiger took the beating.

And the tiger bled.

And the tiger pleaded.

And the tiger screamed.

''Help me, please.'' 

And Frost did not help.

But now, he would do what the tiger had done. 

He would not need gems, because now he knew that gems were meaningless.

The fox had given him so much more, and it was time to give back.

Frost had a plan to defeat Mrs. Brooke.

But Frost would, under no condition, ever be responsible for hurting another soul again.

Even one far past redemption.

If that meant he would suffer for it, so be it.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Pawsteps echoed across the darkened stone floor. The twisted pathways within the Orphanage were all overgrown, torn apart by weeds and eroded by time and neglection.

The only living thing in the entire den was Mrs. Brooke´s garden.

Frost thought it must have been peaceful to sit there. He would have a pen and tell his story among lilies and daffodils, perhaps in verse. He would paint landscape upon landscape, each vaster and more filled with possibility than the next. He would dream while he was awake, and study while he was asleep.

He closed his eyes as the pawsteps drew nearer. He steadied himself, and focused on his breathing. 

He was blowing up balloons for the fox´s birthday.

The first one was shiny and red, and it would be in the shape of a dog, a pet that the fox had always wanted.

The beautiful vision dissipated, and Mrs. Brooke came to deliver the horrendous reality.

''¨What are you doing, you little rat?! That light is keeping me awake!¨'' She yelled, forehead scrunched up and eyes set ablaze, anger illuminating from every cell of her body.

''¨I´m sorry, ma´am. I was cold. I thought that the light could warm me up,¨'' Frost replied solemnly.

¨''How did you start a fire in the first place?¨'' She snapped back, bewildered and very clearly deprived of sleep.

''¨There´s wood, ma´am, and coal and stone,¨'' Frost answered cautiously.

She paused, looking through the dingy metal bars and into the rabbit´s eyes. Deep within them was Sunny, and even deeper was a younger version of herself, listening to Sunny´s make-believe stories.

''¨Oh. Yes. Very well then,¨'' she whispered, ''¨Go on.¨''

Frost hesitated. He was confused, surprised even. Had Mrs. Brooke so suddenly had a change of heart?

''¨Tell me a story, little rabbit. The longer it is, the better,¨'' Mrs. Brooke added thoughtfully.

''¨A... a story?¨'' Frost questioned, sure he had misheard her.

He decided he would. If he did, he might just live through the night.

''¨I... Well. Alright, then. I´ll tell you a story of my own.¨'' 

And so, Frost did. He told the story of his life.

It started with a foolish urchin, who ran around and made merry through mischief.

Then, the little boy threw a stone at a woman´s window, and the woman threw the stone back. 

And it hit the boy, hard. And the woman came running out, and said sorry immediately. But for many months after, she hurt him, again and again. 

And sometimes, the woman apologized. Sometimes, she did not.

Mrs. Brooke seemed to know, subconsciously, that she herself was being described. She did not seem to mind, either.

Then Frost told her of his first friend in the bleak and dreary world he had grown up in.

The fox.

And then Frost continued on, until he reached the present, and told her of his name.

''¨Frost,¨'' she whispered.

Her eyes flashed. She began to cry. 

''¨It was an unforgiving winter that killed my father.¨''

Her tears turned to frustration. To rage.

''¨It was you. A monster in disguise. Sneaking out for your revenge. You came, and you made me this. You weakened my defenses. You destroyed everything. YOU DESTROYED EVERYTHING!¨''

Frost had no time to react. Mrs. Brooke lunged at him, grabbing him, forcing him against the wall. She slammed his throat, again and again, onto the cold, hard brick. 

She snarled at the rabbit, swiping and slamming and slashing, bursting and burning on the inside, destroying herself as she killed the creature who had never truly killed her father, only reminded her of the inevitable truth: She was a monster.

She had made herself a monster.

She had watched herself become a monster.

She was made into a monster by a monster.

Yet that monster was not the boy named Frost.

It was the world.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The fox woke up to hear screams. He had heard them before, from the innocent tiger. 

But they came from the rabbit.

They came from his friend.

They came from Frost.

The fox screamed, too. The fox pleaded, too. But it was no use.

When Mrs. Brooke was done, so was Frost´s life.

And she padded away in tears, murmuring to herself that one day, she would find betterment.

And the fox was alone.

And the next day, Mrs. Brooke brought all she had left: thousands of gems, given to the fox.

She had sold every last piece of the home she once had.

The fox never saw Mrs. Brooke again.

But he and the children were free.

Frost was meant to be free with them, though. 

But Frost was nowhere to be found.

== Part II - Found ==
''One Month Later''

The fox curled into a ball, lying half-asleep on a dusty orange mat. He had earned a day's rest, after his valiant effort to lead the other children to a new home. He had watched every one of them be welcomed by a loving family, no matter how weak or timid they were.

Except for himself.

So, he rested alone in the Pillow Room, trying not to get too caught up in his thoughts. Frost would've known how to comfort him. Yet Frost was no longer able to.

He couldn't help but wonder why he had not been adopted. Was it his appearance? Did his tattered old blanket and moth-bitten slippers deter joy from him? Was it the fact that he was caked in mud, as he had no soap, fur brush, or shampoo? 

Or was it his personality? Did he talk too much, or not enough? Did he constantly look upset or irritated? 

He fretted on and on, finding more and more problems with himself as day turned to night. Tears wet his eyes and cheeks as they slipped beneath his threadbare cloak. He was unable to make them stop, unable to find any positives within his life. 

He sat alone in the Pillow Room, wishing on stars he could not see. He knew his wishes were already lost, yet he could not bear to give up all hope so soon. And yet, he felt ready to.

''***''

''"Mama?"'' A soft, small pup whispered curiously.

''"Don't worry, honey. Mama's here. She'll keep you safe,"''  a female voice replied warmly.

''"I'll do my best,"'' laughed an arctic wolf. 

''"Thank you, Ember. This means the world to me,"'' the artic wolf added joyously, gazing dreamily into the eyes of a bright orange fox.

''"Mama?"'' repeated the baby, who reached out with an eager paw that met the older fox's.

''"We're both here,"'' Ember, the older fox, answered gently.

''"Two mamas... Yay!"'' the kit squealed happily, throwing its paws into the air as it fell into a world of dreams.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The fox's eyes fluttered open. He found himself belly up, grinning and giggling. Yet his fit of glee was brief: for he soon realized it had just been a dream. There was no fox or arctic wolf greeting him.

But then: A shadow! A beautiful arctic wolf walked into the Pillow Room. She wore a dark purple flower crown, just like the one in his dream! 

Only, when she noticed him, she did not seem as excited as he was. In fact, she turned away within a split second, not even bothering to say hello. 

His lips curled into a frown once more. He wished she would return and wrap her arms around him, crying tears of happiness and jumping for joy, telling him how much she missed him and how much she loved him.

And there would a reason as to why she had left him. It would not be out of her own will. No, she was forced to.

And so, the little fox concocted a story.

"Forced to abandon her brave, strong, little boy, by none other than her own brother, who was secretly a spy for a dark and evil force... the Basilisks! 

"The Basilisks stole magic from innocent, gifted children. They were greedy, and wanted all the power for themselves! They were merciless, even draining life from the phantoms! They were considered unstoppable.

"Even the Alphas did not dare to touch the Basilisks! They feared that it would put their lives at risk, leading to the downfall of every creature in Jamaa! 

"But this little boy, a clever and persistent fox, was still determined to stop them. His mothers, a charming arctic wolf with dark purple and pale yellow fur, and a passionate neon orange fox with a dark gray underbelly, always warned him to be careful.

"They knew of his magic, and had no doubt that he was very powerful, and not only this, but he could easily control his powers. They did not want to discourage him, so they did all they could to give him a happy, wonderful childhood.

"And what a childhood he had! He made many merry memories over the years. And yet, on one fateful day, he heard a terrible BOOM from the floor below him, in his own home!

"Even though he was very brave, he was still afraid. He worried for his parents' well-being. And so he rushed downstairs, and immediately recognized his uncle, a rather introverted black-and-white wolf. 

"But, his uncle quickly turned into something else... 

"A monstrous entity, with leathery, pitch-black wings, a shining silver beak as sharp as a dagger, and from that beak of his came out tentacles... Dozens of them, like a squid's, spitting and hissing! And oh, the horrid thing's fangs- bloody and crooked they were, horrifying on their own!

"And rather than talons, it had claws like a panther's, and a barbed tail dripping venom! And then, with no warning, spikes burst from its chest, which lit up with a flame, and soon it was breathing fire, screeching, howling, destroying everything in its path!

"The fox was trembling with fear, but he could not let his mothers be killed by this horrendous beast! Shockingly, his mothers were fighting back- they hurled bursts of brightness at the gruesome monstrosity, coming in every hue! 

"He called out to his mothers, overwhelmed with anxiety. They promised him that they would do their best to keep him safe, that they would never let him go if they had a choice!

"But alas, they could not rid themselves of the Basilisk. He was far too powerful, absorbing each and every spell they cast. Yet along with this, the fox realized that he too could use magic!

"In the end, he remembered his mothers' warnings. ''Save your strength, Cinder.'' And so he did: He gave in. He told the Basilisk that he would follow suit, so long as his mothers were not hurt.

"His mothers were in tears. The Basilisk had been in the process of draining them. They were too weak to even get up. They swore that they would come back for their sunshine, their all.

"But at the time, they were helpless. The young fox was taken away, and the Basilisk brought no harm to him. However, he was quite foolish: He bragged on and on about how strong he was, and how he had been promoted to a general!

"In doing so, he gave the fox a very detailed description of his new chambers in all their glory, including the prison he was to be placed in. The fox did his best to not smile, to not give a single hint that he had taken note of every little detail.

"And so, when the fox was thrown into what seemed a hopeless jail cell, he quickly formulated an escape plan. There was a fifteen-minute period in which all guards reported to a certain area, far from the exit.

"He eyed the clock in the general's room. It was surprisingly easy not to be caught eavesdropping, as the general spent most of his time bragging to guards, hence unknowingly distracting them, or dozing off in his cushioned, curtained bed.

"First, the fox tested to see how easily the general was woken up. He kicked a pebble across his cell, and not a peep was heard from the general other than yet another loud snore of his own. 

"The fox nearly squealed in excitement. He was free of fear, and quite pleased with himself too. He slipped through the widely-spaced bars of his cell and padded across the cobblestone floor.

"Once he had reached the doors, he was still safe. The general didn't notice a thing! Afterwards, he burst out of the building, overjoyed.

"But he had been gone for much longer than he thought. Years had passed. Time was very different in the fortress of the Basilisks than in Jamaa.

"And now, the fox was afraid. He mourned the likely loss of his family and friends. He sulked his way to his old den, and found no one there.

"He was on the verge of giving up. But then, to his very pleasant surprise, he was powerfully embraced by both of his mothers, who were both well and overjoyed to see him!

"Since that day, the fox was the key to defeating the Basilisks. He kept his promise to stay safe, though: He always came back to his family with a smile, and his wonderful mothers would always insist on a celebration.

"The young fox grew to be a hero, but not just any hero, a happy one with a very happy family."

And that was where the story ended.

Not a soul was there to hear it.

No audience applauded.

But the young fox had felt free while he told his story. 

And so, he spent the rest of the night telling more. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A tall, smiling snow leopard entered the Pillow Room. It was morning by then, and she had just arrived from her den in Jamaa Township. As she opened the old oak doors, a gust of wind burst into the room, bringing in loose petals of bright hues.

Sunlight dappled the room, warming the snow leopard's fur. As she strolled further across the room, she noticed a small fox that had fallen asleep on a large mat. Not wanting to disturb the little fellow, she paused and sat down as quietly as she could.

It was a strange silence, unlike any other she had previously experienced. She was desperate to fill it. Had her daughter been by her side, there would have been no doubt that the room would've been ''far'' too loud. 

The thought only amplified her anxiety, and she felt she was about to implode from the quiet when suddenly, the fox rolled to its side, yawning and stretching its legs.

As soon as she realized she was now standing and had been pacing around the room, she was embarrassed. She regretted the action, not having meant to disturbed the child in the room.

Wait... A child! Alone! He was shivering, clearly unhappy and in pain. He looked like he hadn't eaten in weeks, based on his ever-so-thin limbs.  This quickly captured the snow leopard. She would not let a child suffer like this!

She inhaled sharply and stepped forward. She feared that she would scare the little boy, as her appearance made many believe that she was a phantiminal, with her midnight purple spots and dark gray overcoat. 

She began to mutter words under her breath, trying to encourage herself. She was not a monster, and certainly not half-phantom. She was a kind, caring, snow leopard, who had never hurt a fly. 

But the voice in her head was too powerful: She had hurt someone. She had failed someone. Her own daughter, of all people.

Beads of sweat formed on her forehead, dripping down slowly. She began to shake her head, in a bewildered attempt to reclaim herself. She had done all she could that day. It was not her fault, no, it was fate, out of her control, unable to be altered.

Yet why, then? How could fate be so cruel? What purpose, what right did it have to take the life of a beautiful, clever, girl, one so filled with passion and love? 

Her daughter had meant so much to her: the falling stars she wished on as a child, the majestic mountains she had hiked in her more adventurous years, the thousands of diamonds she had made from her verse novels, the stunning view of the open blue ocean she had given up so they could move to a safer place, the sunshine that used to greet her every morning, the moon that lit up her midnight walks, and so much more.

Tears streamed from her eyes as she swallowed her confidence. Enough is enough: she had to be brave for this child.

"Hello there," she whispered hopefully as the fox, startled, jumped up in surprise.

"Oh! Ma'am! Er- Miss. I- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to fall asleep. I was so tired. I'll- I'll leave now if I must," the fox replied nervously.

"Leave? Oh, oh no. But where are your parents? Shouldn't you be here with someone else? You're far too young to be wandering around alone,"  the snow leopard responded insistently. "Truly, it isn't safe!"

"Oh," the fox muttered, face turning grim. "Do you mean to take me away, then? To prison again?"

For a moment, the snow leopard stood there, shocked. She wiped the tears from her eyes. This couldn't be true. The child was ''imprisoned''?

"No! Absolutely not! Anyone your age shouldn't be out here all alone, much less imprisoned! And, well, you really don't look to be all that healthy. It's urgent that I get you back to your family as soon as possible. You'll need medical attention," answered the snow leopard.

"...Oh, yes. My family. I have two mothers, you know. One is a fox named Ember, the other is an arctic wolf. Have you seen either of them? Ember is bright orange and dark gray. She's a fox, just like me. And the arctic wolf, I can't seem to remember her name, but--"

"You... you don't remember?" the snow leopard interrupted, rather concerned.

"It doesn't matter," protested the fox. "I ''know'' I have a family. They're out there somewhere. And they love me very much."

"...You don't have a family," the snow leopard murmured softly.

The fox grumbled in response. Shortly after, though, he replied genuinely.

"No, but I had a dream that I did. It was quite pleasant, really. And in the dream, I had two mothers, an arctic wolf and a fox, and I was happy. And I fought Basilisks and I was a hero! Well, no, I made that part up. But it made me happy," the fox answered, a faint cheer in his voice.

"You're a storyteller?" the snow leopard asked wistfully.

"I would say so," the fox replied after a brief hesitation.

"You know," she added, "I used to write poetry."

"Poetry?! Oh, that's incredible! Show me, show me!" By then, the fox was jumping up and down, giddy with excitement.

"I wish I could," she sighed, "I haven't written anything in a very long time."

"Oh," the fox muttered, disappointed. 

But, he still had hope: the gleam returned to his eyes, and he sat up once more. "Maybe you could still try to teach me? Or, if not, we could learn together!"

However, the snow leopard changed the subject.

"Well, you should learn about grammar and writing essays first. Have you ever gone to school?"

"I don't think so," the fox responded, "I've heard of it, though. It's a big, tall, building, with lots of children and lots of books."

"Yes, it is indeed," smiled the snow leopard, "it's where all the children go to learn, so that when they're older, they can go to college or get jobs and live a life of their own."

"It's very important, too. Someone your age should definitely be attending school," she added firmly.

"Do you have any shelter? Anywhere to turn to?" The snow leopard questioned, eyes widening with worry.

"...Not really. I have some gems saved up, though," the fox murmured, suddenly ashamed of himself. 

He sniffed, and his eyes began to wet.

"No, no, please don't cry... You didn't do anything wrong. You just need someone to look after you," the snow leopard offered warmly. 

She took a deep breath, and steadied herself as best as she could.

"Would you like to come home with me? I can buy you some new clothes. I have a spare bedroom for you to sleep in. I can take you to school. I have a fire that will warm you and toys for you to play with. 

"And plenty of stories, too! I have seven books of bedtime stories that I can read to you at night. And I'll cook you meals, too, and give you presents for your birthday and the holidays. I'll always take care of you, and I'll do my best to keep you safe," the snow leopard finished passionately.

And the fox, for a moment, was quiet. And then, a single tear rolled down his snout. And then his eyes gleamed once again. And he began to jump for joy once more, screaming ''yes, yes, yes!'' so many times that it made his throat sore, but now, he would finally have someone to take care of him.

Though they hadn't made it official on that day, in their own way, they had. The loving snow leopard and curious fox became mother and son.

The fox had been found.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

''Two Weeks Later''

The snow leopard grinned from ear to ear, finding herself to be much happier while taking care of the fox. She had buried her sorrows for years, only to let them all out in tears the night before she had found him, a beacon of hope, a sign from Mira and Zios that not all was lost. In fact, she was so filled with glee and anticipation that she had woken up at three in the morning to do something very special for the little boy.

She did her best to be quiet, and frankly, it ''was'' a strength of hers; her daughter had always been the one to fill the silence. Still, though, she was at the very least patient, and tried to turn her timid tendencies into a gift: That was what she had done with her poetry.

And after two weeks of taking care of the young fox, she was determined to show him that she could be a good mother, that she ''was'' a good mother. She thought of how excited he had been when she brought up having written poems in the past. And so she inferred that he would be ''overwhelmed'' with joy if she presented him with not just any poem, but a poem depicting how much he meant to her, how deeply she cared for him.

As she sat at her desk at the very break of dawn, she struggled to find those words, though. She barely knew this child yet. But she hated to see an innocent kid without any support, without any love. She found it heartbreaking that he had ''dreamed'' of his parents, ''pretended'' he had a family like having a family was the same thing as having a pet dragon. 

Impossible. 

Yet as a writer, she had to consider that impossible things were just a prompt. "What if" was a simple, two-word phrase that could change the world in a matter of seconds. But as a person, she couldn't live with her head in the clouds. As a person, she was meant to fit in, she was meant to be average, she was meant to normal.

How was she meant to teach a child all of those things? Those unspoken rules of society that she personally accursed, but knew that so many followed like a religion? 

But she didn't want such a creative boy to be restricted so early on. She knew that limiting someone could do more harm than good. 

But what would happen when she let the boy believe in superheroes and Basilisks and unicorns and dragons? What would happen when someone squashed those beliefs, those ''dreams'' of his?

How could she handle the misery of someone so young, so vulnerable, so dangerously curious, when she couldn't sort out her own grief?

She had always known that love was a sacrifice, that loving someone meant being hurt when they were,  that loving someone meant always wanting to be closer to them, that the stronger such a desire was the more it stung when all of it, so close, so possible, so ''almost there'', so close to once-upon-a-time, be ripped out from right underneath you.

The smooth, carpeted floor you had slept on, read on, written on, played on, smiled on, laughed on, dreamed on-- replaced with infinite nothing. Every memory of it stained with darkness. 

She remembered the feeling so vividly.

The days when she wouldn't get out of bed. When she felt too numb to even cry. And when at long last she had pushed everyone in the world who had loved her away, when she believed that her presence ailed them, when she felt a burning pressure that she could remove such pain by removing herself, by ending the cycle of loss she had unintentionally triggered.

And yet, in one of her first novels, a memoir of her middle school and high school years that she had hidden so far away, she had questioned whether one's intention mattered at all.

And that was what had ultimately broken her. 

Herself.

How was she meant to protect a child from such invisible demons? How was she meant to cradle him, to lie and say that all would be well soon, when she knew that the opposite was the truth? How could she keep him from doing the same awful things she had, and keep him from thinking those terrible, terrible thoughts?

No, she could not write a poem about love, not when she still struggled to find it for herself.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The young fox woke up very early, though for him, it was the regular time. By 4:00 AM, he had changed out of his pajamas, made his bed, brushed his teeth, and bathed. Excited for his first day of school, he took little care in the tying of his shoes, sloppily shoving his paws into them then rushing down the hall to find his new mother.

To his shock, she was asleep in her own room, clearly not even noticing his presence. He decided that it would be impolite to awaken her (even though he believed it was an appropriate time to), so he trotted off to the kitchen, leaving the door open in the hopes of her waking up and making breakfast for him.

Upon his arriving at the kitchen, he realized that he had no idea what to eat or how to cook. He had never seen a refrigerator or an oven in his life, and was extremely confused.

''What are all of these machines?'' He thought to himself uncertainly.

Nervously, the fox approached the stovetop, accidentally bumping into one of its knobs- and lighting a burner. ''Flash!'' The fox jumped back, stammering in fear.

His immediate instinct was to call for help, but he bit his tongue in reluctance, worrying that he would bother his mother or be seen as weak and cast away. So the innocent kit searched the kitchen, desperate for something to douse the fire: A spatula, a teapot, a seder plate, a peeler, a wooden spoon, a frying pan, a colander, a bread knife...

No, no, no. None of them would work. The fox began pacing, his anxiety increasing-- the fire didn't appear to be growing, but what if it started to do so suddenly, and the entirety of the kitchen was burnt to the ground all because of his indecisiveness? Flustered, he growled, walking even faster, batting at the cabinets, hopping up and down to the reach the shelves, only to find himself more and more frustrated.

The wood floor of the hallway began to creak, and a shadow cast overhead. Had someone broken in? Was he about to be killed? The fox staggered backwards, whimpering in fear, and pushed back a cabinet that he had opened.

"What's all of this ruckus?" the shadow asked drowsily, shifting in the darkness.

"I- Please don't hurt me! I'm- I'm trying to douse the fire!" The fox exclaimed, jabbing a claw at the stovetop.

Then, the shadow stepped into the light. It was no thief. It was the snow leopard. His mother.

"I'm not going to hurt you," she said softly, walking slowly towards him. "Are you alright?"

"I- I- the- the fire. It just- it came out of nowhere! I'm s- sorry, I didn't know what to do-" He started anxiously.

For a moment, the snow leopard turned towards the stovetop in confusion- then, she saw that the burner was on, and laughed to herself. "That's nothing. It's just the oven. See the silvery knob? If you turn it or bump into it, it will tell the stovetop- with these burners- to light a fire."

"...Oh," he murmured embarrassedly, "Whoops."

She proceeded to show him how to turn the stove off, smiling politely all the while. A part of her, though, was scared- How could a child be so fearful and know so little? 

The snow leopard leaned closer, her vision blurring as she crossed her eyes- she blinked several times, still appearing slightly confused. "...You've nothing to apologize for. You just haven't used an oven before. Although... Why are you all dressed up?"

"School," he answered, his voice a whisper, "Was I not supposed to?"

"Oh! Well, school isn't on weekends. Only during the weekdays. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Today is Sunday, so there's no need to get up..." she paused, glancing at the clock, her mouth widening before she continued- "''This'' early."

"S- Sunday? But I don't see any sunlight," the boy replied questioningly. "That can't be right."

"You don't know your days of the week?" she inquired, a bit surprised. 

"I've never even heard of Sunday," he responded honestly. 

"My," the snow leopard muttered, "Well, I... I suppose I ought to teach you then."

"Yes," the boy nodded eagerly, "Please! I'd love to start school early. That way, I'll be smarter than all the other kids."

She swallowed, trying to stop herself from saying ''I'm not so sure about that,'' and ended up not replying at all. She plopped down in a chair, wincing at the realization of her aching back, and somewhat hesitantly patted the stool next to her, motioning for the little kit to sit besides her.

Shortly after, the kit leaped up onto the stool and sat down too. He wagged his tail energetically, looking up at the snow leopard with big, starry eyes that reminded her of the moon, which had just recently faded away. 

"Alright," she started with a sigh, "There are seven days in each week..."</text>

== Tears ==
It was destined for Mira to fall in love with Zios. She had no choice. From the moment he breathed life into her form and very soul, she was his, like the grass, and the trees, and the sunlight whose rays graced every corner of Jamaa, no matter how deep or hidden. He was the center of the world, the source of all of her wonder. Perhaps she loved him because he was her creator, and he had willed it so. Or because she had truly gained an attachment to him, the only other being whose mind was remotely in likeness to hers.

He taught her everything. Once, they landed in a forest of his. The trees were packed together so closely that their branches were hugging and overlapping with one another, creating a blanket of leaves that shadowed the ground beneath. It was dark, and strange, to not feel the sun. But Zios comforted her with the glow of his presence and showed her how to grow the trees, from seed to sapling to a behemoth reaching for the sky. It was his gift to her: an aptitude for growth, for life, for healing. It was her purpose. She was to be the gardener of Jamaa.

Seasons passed, and all was well, for Zios was with her. He was kind, patient, and loving. He shared all that he was and all that he had with Mira, and she did the same. There were no reservations or secrets between them. They simply were. It was a pure and sweet love, a true, unbreaking one. Or so Mira had thought.

There came a day that she awoke in her garden, absent of Zios' presence. His aura, normally calming and warm, was not there. She spread her great wings and leapt into the air, soaring over the lands he had spent so long molding and cultivating into perfection, but she could not find him. She flew and flew, and even dived into his rivers and seas, but he had not gone for a swim. When night fell, Mira had resigned herself to the truth. Zios had left her.

She laid alone in the forest where he first showed her how to grow. He had not said a word about leaving. She did not understand why he left her. Her soul ached, longing for its other half. There were the animals that she loved dearly, but none of them could understand her half as well as Zios did. Why would he create her with a mind so distant, so imperceivable to anyone but him, only to leave her alone? Even with all of the intelligence Zios had given her, she could not find the answer.

Mira was utterly alone. And for the first time, she wept.

Her tears collected in pearlescent drops in the corners of her eyes. They surprised her - she had never experienced them before. What strange wetness, she thought, running down her cheeks.

And the more she turned over Zios' departure in her mind, the less sad she became. She felt something else for the first time - anger!

What right did he have, to leave her behind? How crude and egotistical! How crass!

The tears that fell from her eyes were laden with her potent mixture of grief and anger. As they fell, they grew heavier, until they landed on the ground as clumps of oil-slick bile. And as more tears came, they dropped into the clumps, until they grew, and gained a conscience. A conscience of fear, anger, and betrayal. The first phantoms rose from Mira's tears. And when she finally stopped her crying, they had already left, gone into the shadowy depths of the forest where they hid easily.

A godless age had begun...

      <text bytes="3022" sha1="0l76qc3wcepmps42av0vqdutovu6vsb" xml:space="preserve">In the dimly lit world of Animal Jam, there lurked a mysterious figure known only as EntityReturns. His presence was unnerving, for he communicated solely in Morse code, his cryptic messages haunting the game's chatrooms. His wolf, a sinister creature, bore a jet-black coat with a blood-red swirl, its eyes piercing white beacons in the darkness.

Equipped with a chilling ensemble, EntityReturns wielded a spectral blue sword, donned a spectral police hat, and adorned diamond-encrusted gauntlets and tail armor, marking his ominous aura.

Whispers spread that EntityReturns had hacked two unfortunate users, Arcticskys and Wingedfire, who had vanished from the game without a trace, their absence stretching beyond 30 ominous days. The community shuddered as they wondered what sinister fate had befallen them.

But EntityReturns was not finished. His eerie focus turned to a new victim, the unsuspecting Sassy2092. The air grew heavy with apprehension as players caught glimpses of his shadowy figure stalking the virtual realms, his intentions shrouded in malevolence.

Rumors circulated of bizarre sightings, of a ghostly wolf with eyes like stars and a figure draped in diamond-encrusted darkness. Whispers of Morse code messages that seemed to beckon, promising secrets or foretelling doom.

As Sassy2092 logged into the game, an unsettling sensation crept over her. Strange occurrences plagued her every step, the once bright and cheerful world now tainted by an unshakable sense of dread. EntityReturns had woven his web of fear, ensnaring her in a nightmare from which she could not awaken.

The legend of EntityReturns grew, a specter haunting Animal Jam, a tale of hacked accounts, vanished players, and a looming threat that lingered in the digital shadows. And amidst the game's innocent facade, the unsettling question remained: who would be next to fall under the chilling influence of EntityReturns?

In the heart of Jamaa Township, nestled within the cozy confines of the pillow room, whispers circulated of a shadowy figure, a presence that seemed out of place amidst the whimsical comfort of the space. Witnesses spoke of glimpses, fleeting and eerie, of a spectral wolf with eyes like stars, and a player draped in diamond-encrusted darkness.

Some claimed to have spotted EntityReturns, his Morse code messages echoing through the room, weaving an unsettling tapestry of cryptic warnings and chilling prophecies. Others dismissed these accounts as mere fabrications, yet a lingering unease settled over the once cheerful gathering place.

Players hesitated to linger too long in the pillow room, a sense of foreboding tainting the air, as if the very fabric of the game had been tainted by EntityReturns' ominous presence. The legend of the enigmatic figure grew, his influence casting a pall over the once joyous space, leaving players to wonder if they were truly alone in the room or if something sinister lurked just beyond their field of vision.

[[File:Letters of the Komodo Brothers-Volume 1.jpg|center|thumb|Elm is the green one, and Admiral is the orange one]]
''The tale of two brothers about relationships, danger, and chickens.'' 

'''Letters of the Komodo Brothers''' is a series of posts that line up to create a story of two Komodo dragon brothers named Admiral and Elm. Admiral is a brave, nerdy, and playful Komodo brother with a  goal to help find the Komodo dragon heartstone and Elm is his rude, arrogant, yet fatherly and hard-working older brother. There is one volume so far, which focuses on the start of Admiral’s journey and Elm’s farm.

== Plot overview ==
Links to chapters are under construction. Please go to AJPW wiki, go to search and search up “Letters of the Komodo Brothers”, click posts, and you should be able to view them! 

=== Volume One ===
Admiral has began his great journey to explore Jamaa and uncover its secrets. His brother, Elm, wants to pursue a career in farming, but since his sister who he cannot live with due to family issues already claimed the original Orangeclaws farm, he relocates to Canyons Pathway and marries Dove Daisyflower. On the northwestern side of Jamaa, Admiral explores and eventually takes his round back to Coral Canyons, where he gets into a bar fight with a  rugged camel. Elm is utterly annoyed by the mass majority of his discoveries in his letters, so he sends back oranges and family photos back to bribe him to stop writing down his discoveries.

However, trouble strikes Elm’s farm and also, when a maniac customer asks for some things, he accidentally locks himself in the closet, along with the crazy man. Suffering from little food, he demands Admiral’s help, but it seems Admiral’s response came off more careless than it was supposed to be. Elm begins his memoir, and although the broken family ties, he plans to forgive Admiral for both their actions.

== Characters ==

* '''Admiral Orangeclaws:''' A eight-year-old (24 years in human years) Komodo dragon explorer who had his venom glands removed when he was young for surgery. Admiral has a nerdy yet brave personality with a playful tone of voice. He isn’t afraid of bar fights or battling phantom bears, making him a born leader. The lizard helped discover the corvace fox heartstone.
* '''Elm Orangeclaws:''' A eight-year and two months old Komodo Dragon and the brother of Admiral. Despite his rude and aggressive attitude, he is kind and protective to his brother. As the husband of a nervous farmer, he has to do tons of farm work, but he doesn’t mind so. Contrary to belief, Elm is not an expert at marketing, nor does he know how to deliver mammal offspring like stereotypical farmers.
* '''Dove:''' The caring wife of Elm. She is described as fidgety, worried, and nervous, but determined and intelligent. 
* '''Juniper Frillyruler:''' Admiral’s travel partner. Although she is fidgety and slow, she can help others due to her knowledge of the medical field.
* '''Avalon:''' The owl alpha. They are brave, knowledgeable, and willing like an alpha can be.
* '''”Horse Dude”:''' A nonsense horse with a barking voice who doesn’t know simple things like ukuleles (consuming one), paper (swordfighting a jar with a sheet), and spiders (thinking three were Barbie dolls). 
* '''Bear:''' A fast and loyal yet paranoid grizzly who speaks fluent Spanish. He understands English perfectly, but usually speaks Spanish under choice. 
* '''Duchess Orangeclaws:''' The fussy nine-year-old (28 in human years) older sister of Admiral and Elm. She and Elm always squabbled, leading to separation for good in their adult years. However, Duchess is quite helpful when packages are mixed up.
* '''Cowboy Camel:''' A drunk and violent camel who shot Admiral once in a bar fight. 
* '''Poshmoon Jr. Greenivy:''' A kind-hearted, friendly yet combative crocodile who rediscovered the Komodo dragon heartstone. He is excellent at explaining things, but has a terrible childhood. From bullies to his father overworking to the war happening within Reptile Forge, the explorer has some trauma. 
* '''Baroness Bluecloud:''' A jammer who Admiral once had a crush on. They have yet to make an appearance.
* '''The Orangeclaws:''' 25 children who are the offspring of ‘Father’ and ‘Mom’ excluding Admiral, Duchess, and Elm. Only Elm and Admiral’s batch has known names. 
* '''‘Father’:''' The presumably deceased father of the Orangeclaws children who was/is generous and helped save Admiral’s life in some dangerous situations. Since Duchess “claimed the farm”, it is a possible hint that she earned inheritance from her parents who are either deceased or retired.
* '''‘Mom/Mother’:''' The presumably deceased mother of the Orangeclaws children who was/is an intelligent, cautious, and satire woman with a career of a farmer. Since Duchess “Claimed the farm”, it is a possible hint that she earned inheritance from her parents who are either deceased or retired.

== Trivia ==

* Most of the names are AJ animal names.
* The story’s rising action is heavily inspired by Carl Hiassen books, and the story is sort of based off Super’s own experience, while mixing a bit of her friend’s in.
* Super has joked that Admiral’s theme is “I Won’t Back Down” by Tom Petty because of his personality and a sort-of version of herself.

== Reception ==
The series was claimed by users for “rising the triumph of action into the calm, serene side plot of brotherhood and family history”, but also sometimes criticized for censored language.

'''WARNING: &lt;u&gt;This story is PG-13. It contains swearing, mentions of queerphobia, self-harm, verbal/physical abuse, alcohol abuse, violence (but not particularly gory), character death,  and (somewhat) child neglection. PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS IF THESE THINGS WILL TRIGGER YOU. THIS STORY IS WRITTEN FOR AWARENESS PURPOSES, BUT IS NOT ENTIRELY CHILD-FRIENDLY AND WILL INCLUDE THE MENTIONED WARNINGS. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!&lt;/u&gt;'''

A Brief Note Before I Start The Story. 

''This story is entirely fictional, but the problems between the characters are indeed real. I wanted to write this to bring up these often-overlooked issues, especially mental health, abuse (in all its forms), and self-love. Note, this is mostly based on my perspective, and not so much research. It is partially written in verse, as I wanted to be a bit more liberal with the formatting in an attempt to invoke more emotion.''
 
Most importantly: In life, not all stories have a happy ending. But you won't know which ones will or won't. So, enjoy it as much as you can. But never pretend it's amazing, especially if it isn't. If things are going downhill, please reach out to someone, anyone that you trust.

I know it can feel impossible, but there is a way to find love.

I wrote this story to prove it.

So, enjoy it as much as you can.


'''&lt;u&gt;One: When I Had A Skylight&lt;/u&gt;'''

''When I had'' 

''A skylight,'' 

''Everything was'' 

''fine.'' 

''I could see the stars,''

''I could see''

''Wishes for miles,''

''I could smile''

''I could have something so bright''

''Just be mine.'' 

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I SAT DOWN IN MY CUSHIONED CHAIR, LISTENING TO MUSIC ('''the first way to fill the silence''') to try to get my mind off things.

Everything had happened so quickly: My brother, my parents, the move, new school, new peers, new house, new neighborhood.

No more ice cream truck just around the corner. 

''But no more Elio to beg for ice cream in the first place.'' 

No more kindred, omniscient librarian with the perfect book for everyone. 

''But she had to go to the hospital anyway.''

No more perfect mom and dad who were married just because they loved each other.

''But neither of them were ever perfect.''

No more friendly, philosophical old man who shared words of wisdom and a cup of tea with anyone who asked.

''But he was wheezing between every word of every saying.''

No more big, beautiful house with plenty of space and a pool to dive into ('''the second way to fill the silence''').

''But I couldn't try out for swim team, anyway.''

No more friends to turn to when things got bad.

''But I only ever had one friend.''

No more just '''knowing''' what to say, because you know your classmates and you know your teachers and you know your neighbors and know the whole wide world in your head that's just a tiny little insignificant dot in the real whole wide world.

''But I never said much to my classmates, anyway.'' 

The truth is, I never said much at all.

So how am I supposed to start saying things when my whole wide world has turned upside-down? 

('''See ''Five Ways To Fill The Silence''''').

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

My little brother Elio used to fill the silence. 

His laughter was so loud and vibrant, like a buoy being cast into a stormy ocean, a tether to half a chance at life.

But Elio was so much more than half a chance.

And now all he is...

Is gone.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I tried to turn the volume up. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

But nope, my mom was still yelling at me.

"Ezra, get downstairs! Chris is here for dinner!"

After she repeated the sentence for what felt like the millionth time, I heard an unignorable ''BANG'' on my door. ''BANG BANG BANG.'' Just turn the volume up. Chris doesn't really want to have dinner with me anyway. He glared at me whenever I corrected him for misgendering me. ''BANG BANG BANG.'' 

"Ezra, honey, you're being rude! ''Please'' come down for dinner."

''BANG BANG BANG. BANG BANG BANG.''

When the banging got too loud, I put my headphones on. Even clearer, and I wasn't being rude anymore. Perfect.

But when the banging finally stopped, Mom and Chris were opening at the door, Chris not even bothering to mask his disgust as his eyes found my wall of pictures with Aiden. 

Mom smiled tightly and looked at me, hard. I could feel her stare but didn't feel like staring back. I sat in my cushioned chair, listening to music, as Mom and Chris whispered things to each other indistinctly until finally Mom came, tapped me on the shoulder, and with no further warning, slammed my computer shut, picked it up, and swept it away.

But she wasn't just taking my computer.

She was taking my music.

She was taking one of my ways to fill the silence.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"Jesus," Chris muttered, "what a f****** b****.  Don't you ever get tired of her?"

''Her.'' 

I wanted to scream so, so, badly. To smack Chris across the face. But what would my Mom do? Because she couldn't believe he was bad news. She never believed ''any'' of them were bad news.

Chris was her tenth boyfriend, and it seemed like they had only gotten worse after each breakup. Because Dad was fine. He was nice. The only problem was? He didn't love her. He didn't love my mom. He still doesn't. 

But they were ''friends''. He never cheated on her. He wasn't a massive A-hole like Chris was. Dad was ''good''. He ''accepted me''. 

But Mom wanted someone who loved her, ''really'' loved her, but Chris's love looked like poison to me, like a sly anaconda coiling up for the final strike, like our untamed ancestors with their bloodstained teeth, like mom was the rabbit and Chris was the fox, but everyone says we aren't like that anymore, we can't be predators because Mira and Zios and Jesus and Allah and whoever else they believe in blessed us.

Mom saw Chris as a handsome tough guy, who was persistent, made good money, and complimented her excessively, and his flirtatious tendencies weren't weird or creepy, they were just him, they were him being nice, him saying she was pretty and looked good in a tight skirt and not him being disgusting.

I saw Chris as wrong, wrong, wrong.

Mom saw Chris as right, right, right.

Mom liked believing she was right.

So she stayed that way and so she let Chris stay and so she shut me out.

She shut out her kid, not her daughter. Not ''her''. I'm not a her. Not a girl.

But then she let Chris in.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I ended up coming downstairs for dinner. I didn't want to. Not at all.

I knew it would end horribly. It always did.

But this wasn't the end.

Not yet, it wasn't.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"So," Chris said sluggishly (he seemed drunk, but Mom also seemed drunk, because Mom did whatever Chris wanted her to do), "I was thinking we could head out tonight, Emelia. Wouldn't that be nice?"

''Emelia''. Mom's real name, because no mom's name is actually Mom.

I never called her that. Why did Chris get to call her that?

Mom giggled. She ''giggled''. She hadn't laughed in ''years.''

She was definitely drunk.

I hated what I was watching. It screamed wrong, wrong, wrong, and it felt gross and squirmy and weird inside of me, and I wanted to throw it away, I wanted to burn it to the ground, but I didn't want to break my Mom's heart because it had already shattered into a million pieces a hundred thousand times.

"I agree," she slurred giddily, "let's go, honey."

''Honey.'' A nickname. Already.

''Wrong, wrong, wrong.''

Mom and Chris fumbled out of their chairs and lousily bumped into the table about seven times before they managed to grab their coats and leave the house.

Before Mom left me.

Before Elio left.

But Elio never chose to leave.

We prayed to God every second of every day that Elio would come back to us perfectly healthy, and instead of helping like everyone says He's supposed to, God gave me a curse. 

He cursed me so that everything and everyone I ever loved would be hurt.

And each time someone I loved got hurt,

I loved myself a little less. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Believe it or not, Chris wasn't in my life for so, so many years.

Believe it or not, I once had a happy, healthy little brother named Elio.

Believe it or not, Dad, my ''real'' dad, was a good man.

Believe it or not, I haven't prayed to God since Elio died. Not even to bring him back.

Believe it or not, my one friend in the whole wide world was my love, my ''real'' love, Aidan, but the whole wide world (or maybe God) tore me apart from him.

Believe it or not, the nurses tried everything they could to save him, to save Elio, even praying.

Believe it or not, it's the world who's crazy, the whole wide world who thinks so childishly that everything can be fixed by a higher power instead of themselves. That all they have to do is be a good little servant and then their life will be magical.

Believe it or not, no one's life ever stays magical.

Believe it or not, my life was magical until my parents got divorced.

And to be honest, I predicted this one: 

Chris and Mom didn't come home until 10:49 PM the next night. 

Believe it or not, they had left the house at 7:00 PM the night before.

Believe it or not, my Mom didn't even bother to bring her phone or any device at all, in case of an emergency.

''...Did she not even think about what I could've done (to myself) in those twenty-eight hours and forty-nine minutes?''

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

At exactly 10:51 PM, Mom hung her coat up.

I was sitting in the living room, waiting for her. Right in front of her.

Then Chris came in. He was laughing a little. He slipped his paw into Mom's, grinning.

Mom blushed. She was smiling.

"We should do something like that again," she whispered, but before I could even imagine what bribery Chris had seemingly succeeded at executing, I looked at Mom dead in the eye and she was so blatantly lovesick that it stung.

He couldn't tell her Chris was a terrible person, even if he was- even ''though'' he was.

Because he had ''lovesick'' written all over him six months ago, before the move.

And he was still in love.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"Ah. You," Chris murmured, irritated upon simply seeing me.

A part of me was tempted to spit at his paws or sock him in the head or poke him until he imploded or just ''something, anything'' because I ''knew'' he was bad.

But I didn't.

Because I couldn't.

And because no matter how evil he is,

...I shouldn't.


Chris growled, glaring daggers at me. "Look, kid, ignoring me isn't doing you ''any'' favors. I ''told you'' to ''clean the house'' while we were gone. So ''why'' isn't it clean?"

"You didn't tell me," I responded matter-of-factly, trying my best to maintain a polite composure.

"Why, you little--"

"Chris, sweetie, take it easy. Ezra is going through a lot," Mom interjected pleadingly.  "I'm sure sh- ''they'' don't mean to cause any trouble. I'll tidy things up later."

"''She, "'' Chris muttered under his breath.

I took it all back. I ''really'' wanted to punch him then.

But I didn't, because I couldn't, because I shouldn't.

"Chris, babe... I thought we talked about this," Mom muttered, trying to be subtle, but, well... it was obvious.

At least she was trying.

But not hard enough.

She and Chris walked into the kitchen to talk. News flash: I heard all of it.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;

"Oh, ''please.'' You really expect me to give up all my faith for some snooty kid I don't even ''want?"''

''"''I ''know'' you don't want kids, Chris. But whether you like it or not, I have a kid of my own to take care of. That kid just happens to be nonbinary," Mom said, exhausted.

"The Lord gave every creature in Jamaa a gender, attached to his or her body an soul. He did not wake up one day and decide to create a psychotic spectrum that made everything impossible to understand. He did not decide to give a thirteen-year-old ''girl'' a ''sacred'' religious celebration because she ''said'' she was a boy."

"You're allowed to believe what you want, Chris, but the way you're treating Ezra isn't fair. At least respect them," Mom retried hopefully.

"Oh, should I start asking flowers about pronouns? Should I try to figure out if my dog's barking means it's coming out to me?" He scoffed bitterly.

"Chris, that's not how it works, it's more complicated than--"

"Am I supposed to respect a petty, antisocial psychopath who calls my ''religion'' a ''hate crime''?" Chris yelled, his anger tripling.

"N- No! I mean, Ezra doesn't say that! They just- They just wish you were more open-minded," Mom answered, clearly anguished.

"No. No, this conversation is over. I am not about to throw away the teachings of ''generations'' of my own family for your pathetic little girl. If you bring this up again, it ''will not'' go well, do you understand?"

"W- What? Chris, I just-- This is a misunderstanding, okay? That's not what I meant. I want you to be happy. But I don't want to hurt Ezra! I just want-- I want to give Ezra a good family. A good father," Mom pleaded, her voice breaking midsentence. 

She finally saw Chris's poison, but she didn't do anything.

Because she couldn't.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

After Chris and Mom talked, Chris left, telling her he needed &lt;nowiki&gt;''time to think.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I tried to be gentle. Mom was breathing heavily, her eyes wider than I thought was possible. 

"Mom..." I said softly, striding toward her as carefully as I could.

"Chris is a good person," she whispered to herself, "we had a wonderful night and this won't happen again. We aren't going to fight over stupid things."

But I stopped, and I froze, and I felt hot tears welling up in my eyes, because she had called my identity a stupid thing, she had called Chris's threat a stupid thing, she had given up and she was so scared and so anxious but she was trying to be perfect, and now she was seeing ''me'' as an imperfection.

And I ran up to my room, shut the door, and started writing ('''the third way to fill the silence''').

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I looked towards the wall. Plain off-white, times infinity.

But plastered on the bland color was pictures of Aidan and I, filled to the brim with joy, cheeks flushed red, snickering and grinning and smiling and giggling and beaming and laughing and playing and joking and ''living'', ''breathing,'' being in the moment with no silence to fill.

How was I supposed to do those things with him, feel those things with him, when he wasn't by my side?

We hadn't ever talked about going long-distance. We hadn't even expected it. 

And now that we were...

What would happen?

''Were'' we? Aidan had never explicitly said so.

But of course we were, because we weren't 20 minutes away anymore, we were a three days' trip away, by car.

And I didn't even have a car of my own to drive.

Neither did Aidan.

At least, not when I last saw him two months ago.

I hadn't texted him since then. But I needed someone to lean on. Someone like Aidan. 

And he was only a text away, in that moment. But I scrolled up, and there were so, ''so,'' many unanswered texts.

Aidan knew that I had...

relapses

sometimes. 

And there were so many words

''So many words''

I wanted to scoop them all up, scoop ''him'' up, and hug him as tight as I could, as soon as I saw everything:

AIDAN:  ''Hey Ezra, how are you?''

AIDAN:   ''I hope things are going good''

AIDAN:  ''How's your new high school? Make any friends yet?''

AIDAN: ''No worries, I'm sure you will if you haven't''

AIDAN: ''You're incredible after all''

AIDAN: ''I was lucky to go on ONE date with you''

AIDAN: ''I'm pretty sure there were a few other kids pining for you, no matter how emo you were''

AIDAN: ''Too bad for them, now that we're officially going out.'' 

AIDAN: ''I sent you a present in the mail for our first anniversary. You should open it :3''

AIDAN'': I know it's only been a few weeks, sorry if I seem clingy. I love you though''

ME: ''It's fine. I miss you, too, Aidan.'' 

ME: ''But I'm not opening the present yet bc it's too early''

AIDAN: ''Whaaaaatt''

AIDAN: ''Rude''

AIDAN'': I feel betrayed''

ME: ''You KNEW it was too early''

AIDAN: ''Maaaaaybe''

AIDAN: ''So what if I did?''

AIDAN'': Seriously though open it! I wanna know what you think''

ME: ''We still have a month to go doofus''

AIDAN:  ''don't care if you call me a doofus because I know you love me too :)''

ME: ''hmmm do I tho''

AIDAN: ''Wow am I getting rejected??''

AIDAN'': Too bad for you you'll never get Valentines Day chocolates''

ME: ''WAIT NO I WAS JOKING PLZ''

ME: ''I miss youuuu''

ME: ''We're so far apart now''

AIDAN'': Yeah I guess you're right about that''

AIDAN: ''We can handle it though''

ME: ''I don't know it's hard without knowing you're right there''

AIDAN: ''What do you mean?? I'm always here Ezra''

AIDAN: ''I care about you I'm not going to ditch you just because you're a few hours away''

ME: ''Seventy-two hours isn't a few hours''

AIDAN'': Ezra is everything alright?''

AIDAN: ''I really mean it I DO care about you''

AIDAN: ''If something's wrong you can reach out to me, I LIKE talking to you even when it's hard''

AIDAN: ''I'm not going to let any amount of miles, any amount of kilometers, break us apart''

''AIDAN: I'm not messing around when I say "I love you." It's just the truth. It's how I feel about you. I don't want to throw those feelings away. You mean so much to me Ezra. Please reply. I just want to know you're OK.''

ME: ''Aidan let's face it neither of us can do this''

ME: ''You should just move on and find someone else''

''AIDAN: What?? Ezra where in Jamaa did this come from?? I'm REALLY worried about you. I can't just move on from that. You're acting really out of sorts all of a sudden. Please can we Facetime or something?''

ME: ''Look I'm sorry I just hate seeing your face without being able to touch it''

ME: ''It just feels like I can't even give you a hug anymore, ever again, and I don't know why but that hurts me, it feels like I can't really know what you're feeling, I'm sorry I just can't''

''AIDAN: I'm not a different person Ezra, I swear. I've had a crush on you since eighth grade. Is that not a big enough feeling for you??''

''AIDAN:  I'm sorry that was a bad question it sounded demanding''

''AIDAN: You don't owe me anything seriously, I just want to know you're alright it will make me feel better''

''AIDAN: And if you're not alright then we can still talk! If you want me to try to come over I can try and find a time. I'm just really busy lately. I wish I could see you though, I really do. I want to talk to you. I want to be with you. I love you''

''AIDAN: Ezra you are incredible, you're beautiful and talented and adorable and handsome and your identity is valid and I care about you so, so, much, please just respond, I'm getting really anxious''

''AIDAN: I'm sorry if I'm pressuring you I never wanted to hurt you''

''AIDAN: I know it's hard now that we can't just automatically be near each other but that doesn't mean I don't love you anymore, it doesn't change any of my feelings at all. I know this is unexpected and you hate the unexpected but just this once please try to embrace it. Difference can be challenging to understand but that doesn't mean it's impossible to.'' 

''AIDAN: If there's anything I can do to help just let me know. I want to be there for you so, so, badly.'' 

''AIDAN: Ezra, please just send me a text or call me or something, at least let me know if you want to break up at least tell me this is really messing with my head''

''AIDAN: I keep on thinking about you I don't know how to make it stop. My gut is telling me something's wrong and all I want to do is fix it. If I made a mistake you can tell me. I won't back away. I just want to make things better Ezra, that's all''

''AIDAN: Is something wrong?''

''AIDAN: I'm really sorry if I'm bothering you I just don't know what else to do, you haven't replied to anything, every time I try to call you you hang up or don't even pick up at all.'' 

''AIDAN: Ezra please don't feel bad about yourself, I'm still here for you, I always will be. If you need a break just say so. If you just want to be friends now that's fine too I just want to hear your voice again, I want to know you're alive, I want to know that everything is fine, it's okay if you're hurt or don't feel good there WILL be better times''

''AIDAN: Just keep trying Ezra, and I know you'll get far. You mean the world to me. And I know I'm not the only one who loves you. Elio does. Your Dad does. Your Mom does. You have a family. I hope that you're talking to them if not me.''

I did it. I texted him. I texted Aidan. Two tiny, pathetic words that I flimsily stitched together to make up for everything in a way that made up for nothing at all. 

ME: ''I'm sorry.''

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Aidan doesn´t reply for the first five minutes. So I decided to open up my journal. I poured everything into my journal, in one place, all at once. 

All the things I felt and longed for and believed in and thought of and cared about and hated and said and did and saw other people do and heard other people say and tried to do and failed to do and succeeded to do and gave up on and dreamed about and turned to and abandoned and did wrong and did well and did right and everything in the world that ever happened, every moment and minute and second and hour and week and day, centuries of nothing, so much nothing, glorified to become something, history and reality and personal opinion and imagination abolished and remade and transformed and all of it, every single thing in existence

in 

one

journal.

When I reached

the seventeenth page, 

I realized I was panting and sweating and I needed a break.

Some of the ways to fill the silence are hard in the moment, but in the long run, they help. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;

But then I flipped the page again and I saw a drawing from two months ago, crumpled up and yellow-ish and smack dab in the middle of it was a poorly-taped half-wilted rose that was a red darker than blood, free of thorns, the one rose with no thorns I had ever been given in life

The drawing was of Aidan.

Aidan, in his Phantom Beanie, Gold Chain, white Skullys, dark gray Topcoat, and Blackout Boots. With his deep brown eyes that reminded me of warm, gooey chocolate in a brownie, his extra-fluffy tail that he tucked in so shyly when we first met, his sharp-angled fox ears that bent down when we kissed, his soft, strong paws that constantly coerced me to hug him until we both couldn't breathe, his heartbeat that sounded like an orchestra, his hilarious raps and his somewhat-ironic love of ballet, the way he walked with such casual confidence, the way he lowered his voice when he tried to impress me, but he never had to, he never had to try, because he was always amazing to me, he was already defying gravity, he didn´t need to do anything

I was going to draw myself in that picture, but I wasn´t sure how. I like drawing ('''the fourth way to fill the silence''') but I´ve never drawn a self-portrait before. I like drawing people in my life, and I like making the paper seem alive, and I draw little doodles of everything I write about. 

But I´ve never drawn myself

because

when I look in the mirror

I see what other people think.

You might think

that doesn´t make any sense, because you can´t see thoughts, but if you think that, you´re stupid, because of course you can, you can look at someone´s face and their posture and the little tiny movements they´re making and know what they´re thinking.

I´m not telepathic, just observant.

Aidan told me to stop comparing myself to other people. That´s the one thing he never understood. I´m comparing myself to myself. 

Every version of me in everyone else´s eyes.

Chris sees demon, 

Aidan sees incredible.

Mom sees

blinding light

filled with so much hope

and so much regret

that it´s kind of hard to tell

which one, or which one more of, she´s feeling.

But after the conversation we didn´t have, ´I´m pretty sure that all she sees me as is an imperfection. A burden. 

And then I start thinking about the way Aidan sees me might´ve changed, after I didn´t reply to months of texts, after I blocked him on every app I could, after I shut him out so I wouldn´t get hurt and I wouldn´t hurt him, but of course I knew and I know now that I ''was'' hurting him.

I thought if I ignored the problem, it would go away. Aidan and I would get the golden opportunity of reuniting in-person, seeing each other´s faces, and in an instant, knocking the wind out of the world with our love. 

And just as I looked down at the drawing, which my phone was next to, it rung. I looked at the name. 

Aidan.

''Aidan.'' 

'''Aidan.''' 

I took a deep breath and wished that music would start playing so I could drown out the inevitable, so anything that might hurt would fly away for the night, but Mom had taken my music, Mom had taken my music and I couldn´t get it back. 

And I clicked the green button, and I picked up the phone, and I put it to my ear, 

and before I could even breathe, 

Aidan started talking. 

¨I thought you´d never answer,¨ he whispered. 

¨I am,¨ I breathed, ¨I´m listening now. I´m sorry. I´m so, so, sorry.¨

¨I heard about Elio. I thought-- I thought that--¨

I winced. I tried to say something. The silence hurt. It was too vast to swim through, too vast to sing through, too vast to write through, too vast to draw through.

¨...I just wanted to know you were okay, Ezra. I´ve been worried sick for the past six months.¨

It was my turn to start whispering. ¨I know. I know. I´m sorry.¨

And Aidan said the inevitable.

¨I couldn´t even say hi to you. I didn´t even know if you were still alive. Do you know what that was like?¨ 

¨I know,¨ my voice broke, ¨I missed you.¨

¨Then why?¨ Aidan pleaded. ¨Why did you push me away?¨

¨I´m sorry,¨ I repeated pitifully, ¨I didn´t want to hurt you. But I did. I know I did.¨

¨For six months, you disappeared. For six months, I wondered if you´d been beaten to death, I wondered if you´d relapsed, I wondered if you hated me, if you were punishing me, if you'd broken up with me, if you'd forgotten about me, if you were burying your feelings, if things were getting worse, if you had anyone to reach out to," he panted, exasperated. "But you didn't tell me anything. You didn't tell ''anyone''."

"Aidan, I'm sorry. I know I messed up," I cried, willing the conversation to end, to turn back in time, to dive into an ocean, to write until I had no words left, to paint every inch of every wall, to break my ears with broken records, 

And then it was quiet

and the quiet

hurt so much

like 

it

never had

before,

a river of blood

scissors on my desk

I had started cutting the rose petals

the petals of the one rose in my life with no thorns

and the scissors were so close to my arm

and I wanted to cry

And Aidan whispered, "Ezra, I just wanted to know you were OK.

"I just wanted to know that you were OK.

"Please just tell me

if you're OK."

I grazed my fur with the scissors, the dark purple that didn't fit with any other color, the purple too dark to be painted, the painting of myself in my mind that I wanted to burn to the ground because I was scared it would look bad if it ever became real.

"Please," I sobbed, "please come over. I think-- I think I'm going to--"

''C  R A C K'' 

I started throwing up about then. It happened when I got really, really stressed--

too stressed

and it started affecting me physically.

I knew Aidan wouldn't be able to come, and even if he could, even if he did, it would be too late. But he was still there, listening on the phone, even though he could've given up, even though he could've said goodbye, even though he could've ignored me. 

"I'm going to get to you, Ezra, I swear. I will. I have to go right now, but-- I'm going to be back. Don't hang up yet. Please. I'm still here for you. I'm going to see what I can do. Trust me. Please, please don't hurt yourself. It might not feel like it now, but it's going to be OK."

''It's going to be OK''

''is like saying calm down''

''It's going to be OK''

''when I'm being ravaged by a hurricane''

''Of course, of course five words, seven syllables, can fix everything,''

''of course they can fix me-''

Chris opened the door.

"The hell are you doing, f*****? It's the middle of the night!" He yelled

too loud, too loud

I needed anything but Chris

Anything but him

telling me I was worthless

telling me I was a monster

telling me I was delusional

"Chris--" a voice

Mom's voice

too late

too late

"No, I want an explanation. What the hell is going on? Why are you on your phone right now?"

''You DON'T care so WHY are you asking''

I started shaking and trembling and my feet weren't on the floor and Chris's voice was too loud, too much, too angry, too bitter--

And Mom looked terrified, and I knew she was terrified, and I knew she wouldn't do anything, and I knew she wasn't just scared of Chris

She was scared of me.

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Eventually, Chris stormed off in frustration (again) but only after he 

slapped

Mom

across

the face

And she didn´t do anything

even though she could´ve. 

Aidan had been on the phone for

One Hour, Forty-Five Minutes, And Seven (Now Eleven-Twelve-Thirteen-Fourteen-You-Get-The-Point, Now One Hour, Forty-Six Minutes, And Thirty-Two Seconds). 

Which, if you don´t know, is a long time to be on the phone.

At least I sort of felt like

Maybe Aidan cared,

But there was no way he would´ve been able to come to my house, I hadn´t even told him my address, but I wanted him, I needed him, but I didn´t know how to talk to him, because I had hurt him, and it made me want to

___________.

Don´t try to read that as morse code, it will probably translate to gibberish. 

The only reason I won´t spell it out

write it down

is because

I don´t want to.

That might sound like a stupid reason, but you try reliving 

Trying to _____________, 

and see how it feels.

Not good.

But you might not even have a memory of 

''that''-

Because 

you aren´t me,

but that doesn´t necessarily mean

you´re my exact opposite.

But the main reason I´m writing this is because it´s for me.

And because I need to be more selfish.

And I know what I did (and I knew then) to Aidan wasn´t a good thing, and it was selfish, 

but in my head, there are two different types of selfish:

1,  '''Greedy-Stupid-Unnecessary Selfish.'''  That´s the kind of selfish where you´re being so self-centered and egotistic it´s obnoxious, where you´re only worrying about yourself and disregarding others,  constructing an air of superiority when really you´re just being a snob. You´re not thinking straight and you probably aren´t doing the right thing, either. You might mean well, but your meaning-well reasoning might also just be a reason that you subconsciously know is just another petty cover-up, when really it´s bad for you AND other people.

2, ''Self-Love''

''S e l f  l o v e'' 

Self-love. Self-love is not bad-selfish. It isn´t you being stupid. It´s you taking care of yourself. The other selfish doesn´t actually help you. This selfish, self-love, can sometimes be called out as snobby or unfair or ridiculous or dumb, but it isn´t. 

You need to give yourself a break sometimes. You need to remember that you deserve a chance. You need to remember that you´re not all bad. You need to remember that mistakes can be fixed. Failure isn´t inevitable, but it happens, and you shouldn´t be upset about it, because it´s normal.

Perfection is a load of bull****. Go on, say it out loud.

That´s not selfish, OK?

Because when you´re ''really'' being selfish, you´re being irrational.

When you´re loving yourself, you´re healing yourself.

And if you don´t try to heal yourself, the scars will disappear- but not in a good way. They´ll just turn back into fresh wounds.

This is why I´m writing this story. 

You get to figure out why you´re reading it.

Also, sorry for calling you stupid a few times. 

I´m working on it.

But maybe I shouldn´t work on it, because I shouldn´t expect of myself to be an angel all of the time.

I´m not. No one is.

Maybe we shouldn´t think in black-and-white.

Maybe I shouldn´t tell you Chris was completely awful.

I guess I´ll pause for a minute

and make you a list of things that happened to Chris

that might´ve made him

the way he is.

But I´m still mad at him,

Because he chose a path of hate

instead of a path of love.

'''Here´s a list of things that happened to Chris.'''

# When he was five, his parents got divorced (like my mom´s).

2. When he was eight, his dad got sent to jail for the murder of a 16-year-old transgender girl with ADHD and anxiety.

3. The church he went to taught that queer people and disabled people were bad. 

4. He started going to church when he was five. A pastor told him that having divorced parents was bad, too. That because she was divorced, his mom wouldn´t be able to provide for him, and though God may pity her for that, He might not pity her if she was the one to file the divorce (because that would disrespect men, the ´´upper class´´ according to God-- according to the pastor). 

5. Chris believed everything the church taught him, because no other adults told him anything when he was at an impressionable age.

6. Chris never actually learned anything from the Bible. Just the pastor that told him who and what was good, and who and what was bad. So what the pastor said turned into his religion.

7.  Chris never actually met an openly queer or disabled person. He just knew that his father didn´t like them and the pastor didn´t like them.

8.  When he was eighteen, his father escaped jail. His father went to meet him. His father only told him one thing: I did it, I did kill someone, but they misunderstood, because I killed someone who God told me to kill. 

9. The next day (after when he saw his father when he was 18), he learned from the news that his father had killed a cop that had found him, and then ran away again. But he decided that he would stop thinking about his father after that.

10.  When he was 25 years old, he decided that he didn´t want to have kids, because he didn´t know what (or how) to teach them. And he didn´t want to let them down, either. 

'''Now Chris is 34 years old.'''

&lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Back to all the things I´m avoiding telling you. 

Chris and Mom eventually left my room. But Aidan didn´t come, because he couldn´t.

Not because he wouldn´t.

The truth is, I love him. And I did then.

But I couldn´t reach him, because life isn´t always fair.

I stayed in my room that night, trying to solve my problems, despite the fact that I couldn´t, not then, not when they had reared their ugly face in front of the people I´m closest to. 

Not

Now.

Instead of doing anything about the humongous EVERYTHING that was happening, 

I decided to write some more. 

It was the first time I wrote about

Aidan.

I wanted to focus on him, the way I missed him, the way he made me feel, for one more minute.

One more minute, sixty seconds, into sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven... three hours. 

''You´re'' 

''Beautiful''

''in every way''

''Your eyes''

''Have a light''

''That surprises me each time''

''Thoughts of you''

''Make my day''

''You´re the king''

''of my heart''

''And without you,''

''There´s a missing part''

''When I´m with you,''

''It feels like a dream''

''And I don´t want to be seen''

''Anywhere else''

''Because that would mean'' 

''I´m not standing by your side.''

''With you, I´ve laughed and cried''

''Every time I see you''

''It knocks my breath away,''

''But I try to breathe''

''Anyway''

''Because there you are''

''With your golden smile''

''Perfect like the sun''

''I can't even try''

''To not like you''

''Every mile'' 

''I walk towards you''

''is worth my while''

''You are nothing short''

''of incredible''

''With complimenting you, I´m never done''

''Because my feelings for you''

''Are just what´s true.''

''These three little words''

''Are what I long to say''

''Each and every day''

''Whenever you´re away''

''I think of how to say''

''Those three little words,''

''The truth and nothing but the truth''

''Would make me feel''

''As free as a bird''

''If you felt them, too''

''Those three little words''

''Are:''

''I''

''Love''

''You.''

== &lt;big&gt;Prologue&lt;/big&gt; ==


Kai held his breath in as he looked into the pool below himself, off of the diving board. The blue, large ripples of water going back and forth and the splashes of other kids playing made him hesitate longer. For a small, black arctic wolf, he wasn’t afraid of water, but after watching the 1970’s movie Jaws the other night, he felt a little nervous.

“Move already!” An impatient female sheep behind him cried. “You’re holding up the line, idiot!”

He let out a worried growl, and let himself fall into the water. As he submerged, he imagined sharks all around him, waiting to bite into his flesh, or even possibly worse, swallow him whole. He could imagine their big, reddened teeth and their large, thick bodies making their way to have their next meal. But instead, he just saw other kids’ bodies playing mindlessly. He swam up to the surface, and took off his fogged up goggles and finger-brushed his hair out of his eyes. Although he knew there wouldn’t be any sharks inside this public pool, he always thought there could be., and, by the time you wonder why it’s in there, you’d be eaten. 

After a few seconds, Kai dipped his goggles into the water, cleaning out the fog. Then, he made his way through the growing crowds of kids, who were splashing, yelling, and being inconsiderate to anyone around them. 

Almost there, almost away from this nightmare. He told himself as he got to the steps. But, to his luck, a man outside the pool brought out an ice cream stand and a wave of kids came rushing towards the exit to get a taste of the frosty snacks. Before he could exit, a bear stepped on his foreleg and pulled him under, and his head banged against the second step. He felt a massive headache, and saw blood when he opened his eyes. He tried to get up, but more animals trampled over him, pushing his entire body against the steps and floor, the taste of chlorine and blood surging through his mouth. 

Fortunately, one of the kids stopped, and grabbed his arm and helped him up. She was also an arctic wolf, about Kai’s age. She was pink, darker pink, and yellow, with beautiful, ocean blue eyes, looking in his. 

“Are you okay?” She asked, with a look of genuine concern in her eyes, still holding his arm.

“Yeah, getting dragged underwater by a mob of kids is an everyday occurrence for me.” Kai snorted, wiping the blood off his forehead, which- surprisingly- wasn't too much to be concerned with.

The pink arctic wolf chuckled slightly, then they both got up to land, away from the crowd of kids.

“I’m Cornelia… What’s your name?” She asked, once they've gone to safety on the cement.

“The name’s Kai. Nice to meet you, Cornelia.” He responded. “I like your name, by the way.”

“Oh, thank you!  I love yours, too. Both of ours sound like names from The Hunger Games, haha.” Cornelia smiled.

Was that a compliment?

“Thanks…” Kai forced himself to respond in a grateful tone, although he felt slightly confused.

“So, are you new around here or…?” As soon as the words left his mouth, he instantly regretted it. He obviously didn’t know every kid in the highly populated town of Corriodia, and didn’t want to act like he did.

“Yeah! I moved in last Saturday. How’d you know?” Cornelia chuckled. 

“Um, you just… Well… It seems like you’ve recently moved in,” Kai stuttered quickly. “Do you want to get some ice cream?” Moving on from that awkward subject, he gestured to the man selling ice cream. In fact, Kai had been craving ice cream since that morning.

Cornelia’s eyes beamed. “I’d love that!”

However, by the time they got up to the man, there was no more ice cream left.

“Sorry, kiddos,” The man shrugged. “We’re all out.” 

He then simply walked away with his little, pink ice cream cart.

Kai felt disappointed, and then turned to Cornelia.

“Aw, it’s okay. Who cares about ice cream, anyways? It’s just cream that is cold.” Cornelia said comfortingly.

However, that didn’t comfort Kai. He often got disappointed at small, petty things like this. But he had to respond with something.

“Of course,” He muttered unconvincingly, “Ice cream doesn’t matter.”

“Well, I have ice cream at my house, if it matters that much,” Cornelia giggled.

Kai was about to say a sarcastic remark, but then considered her offer and brightened up.

“Wait, seriously?”

“I mean, why not? I only live 2 blocks away... I need to get home anyways, my mom is expecting me to do my chores.”

So this was an invitation.

“I’d love to go to your house to eat ice cream.” Kai finally replied.

They went to her house and had ice cream, and it was the start of a beautiful friendship. 

Kai and Cornelia became so close, they had a (platonic) ship name “Kaielia”, given to them by their classmates a few days after Cornelia joined the school he went to. However… This happiness was short-lived. After 4-6 months, Cornelia disappeared randomly. No note left behind, no one to tell Kai what happened. It was as if she never existed.

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/big&gt; ==
[[File:Kai.png|thumb|Kaing "Kai" Blamecar]]
The loud intro to “Bad Reputation” by Joan Jett alarmed Kai, on the morning of his 18th birthday. He tiredly snatched his phone off his nightstand beside him, and turned off the alarm. Then he stretched out all over his bed, and felt like something was off. He looked at his spray painted bedroom ceiling, and still couldn’t figure out what it was. Then, he remembered. The room wasn’t the problem, it was himself. He was hungover the other night, and was experiencing the after effects. 

“F**k.” Kai said in exasperation under his breath. He then got up from his bed while not bothering to fix it, slipped on some clothes, and went into his kitchen. He grabbed a banana from the fridge, and a cigarette lighter from his back pocket. 

“Now where are those damn ci-” Before he finished his sentence, he realized they were in his front pocket. He grabbed the casing and found that there was only one left. He decided to save it for later, when he’s at school.

He finished his banana, and then looked through his contacts on his phone. It was empty, due to a falling out with his parents a few years ago. He loathed his parents- his dad, who did inappropriate things to little girls and got 40 years in prison, and his mom, who decided to pretend she did not know of that, like a coward. Kai never knew where his mom ran off to after his dad's trial, and didn’t want to learn.

After a few somber moments, he closed his phone, packed his dark red backpack, and went out the front door to wait for the school bus.

He had to wait only a few seconds for it to arrive. If he could count on one thing, it’d be that the bus never kept him waiting. When it stopped and the door opened, he got inside and got strange looks from everyone inside. He heard a couple gossiping girls whisper, “Ugh, it’s that emo a** kid… Wanna bet he’s high as f*** right now?” And the other giggled.

Kai simply took a deep breath while walking into the back. He had to do this every single school day, and it got tiring quickly. He sat in the back of the bus with the other emo kid, who is known as Triple D- “Demon Deer Dairold”, and just tried to relax.

After a few minutes, the bus arrived at the school. He wasn’t quick to get out first, but didn’t want to be last, so he got out as soon as the gossiping girls left.

His first class was precalculus, which was led by Dr. Cowell Firstbreath, a small, brown tiger with a worse temper than Kai’s. They had a strong, mutual hate relationship. 

Kai sat in the back of the class, with his back-feet on the table, but was quickly disrupted by Dr. Firstbreath glaring daggers into him.

“You keep this attitude up, I’m failing you,” Dr. Firstbreath hissed, while slamming a book down on his own desk. But Kai simply rolled his eyes, and sat up straight. Surprisingly, Kai had good grades. At least, in the other classes. Apart from getting drunk or high, homework helped him waste away the years, with “useless” knowledge. Though, if answers got too hard, he’d consider Google to be his best friend. The most helpful and sober one, anyways.

A few minutes into the most boring class, he swiped an airpod into his left ear. A calculator was more reliable than a single class of Dr. Firstbreath’s. However, Firstbreath kept looking at him, blew a whistle, and howled, “Kaing Anatanoff Blamecar, go to the principal’s office! I’m not getting paid just so I can be ignored!”

Kai felt furious suddenly. No one has ever said his full name out loud. It was always “Kai”, or “That Emo Arctic Wolf”. And how was that a valid reason to go to the principal’s office? He never felt such anger seething through his fur. He couldn’t possibly let that creature get away with that. Suddenly, he backed out of his chair, and with all eyes on him, he went up to the teacher, grabbed his shirt’s collar, and pinned him up against the chalkboard wall. He wanted to slam his head in over and over, but the terrified look in his teacher’s eyes made him want to deliver an “intimidating message” instead.

“DON’T say my name EVER again, b****.” Kai dropped him, and stormed out of the classroom.

Instead of going into the principal's office, or going back to apologize, he went outside the school, into this secluded, hidden wall area where the potheads would often intoxicate themselves. Surprisingly, no one was there aside from himself. After waiting a few minutes, just to make sure no one was looking for him, he grabbed the cigarette and lighter from his front pocket, and lit it.

He always knew smoking caused cancer, but he didn’t exactly care too much. In fact, he got this unhealthy habit from his dad, who gave him his first cigarette when he was 15. Another reason why he hated him.

After a few minutes, he heard someone approaching. So, he dropped it on the ground and hid it over his shoe. He saw who’s mild face it was. The principal’s.

“Hello, Kai.” The principal greeted him calmly. He was an understanding, middle aged Direwolf. 

Kai looked into his eyes, but didn’t say anything.

“So, I assume you do know what you did was wrong?” The principal prompted.

“Don’t you have some other kid to expel, Professor Summerhollow?” Kai finally muttered.

“Maybe, but you gotta face the music,” He blinked. “Now, why don’t you tell me your side of what happened.”

Kai stood his ground for a second, considered telling him, then looked at bird passing by, not saying anything.

Summerhollow empathetically sighed. “You have issues, son. Whether you open up or not will always be your choice.” He made eye contact with Kai. “But right now, it’s that time of your life for you to decide who you wanna be. You can’t stay an angsty teen forever. And do you want to be some hurt addict with anger issues?”

Kai felt anger towards him, but held his tongue. 

“You don’t have to talk, but I want you to think about this.” He put his paw on Kai’s shoulder. “In fact, you can think about this in detention.” 

He took him back into the main school, and into detention. In there, it was a bright, white room with 6 chairs with desks on each one. 

Kai sat himself in one, and Professor Summerhollow put a few empty sheets of paper and a new pencil on his chosen desk. Kai looked at the paper, and counted 6 empty sheets.

“What is this?” He grabbed the pencil, staring at Summerhollow.

“Instead of doing busywork, I’m allowing you to reflect on your actions. The paper is to keep you occupied while you think about this.” The professor walked out of the office, leaving Kai to himself.

The clock on his desk was set to 1 hour, which was surprisingly low, for violence and disrespect. He didn’t exactly know what the principal expected. Reflection? Did staring at a piece of paper for an hour help someone reflect? However, he decided to color all the pages in black pencil lead, which took roughly 20 minutes, and made an origami snake. If he could remember one project from his childhood, it’d be making origami creatures. Snakes, for the most part.

Time flew by quickly, and when the clock rang, he excused himself out of the office and walked into chemistry. 

As fate would have it, the class started a few seconds after he walked in.

He paid no attention to the teacher, Ms. Kemi Heatedheart, because the books- and Google- explained chemistry better than this stuttering, jittery brown bunny. It was just another, unspecial class to him. Then, after a bit, the bell rang and he walked into the Jamaasian history class.

This was a class he had a love-hate relationship with. Love the interesting parts, hate the boring ones. For example, The Vampire Wars vs The Appondalian Republic Rebellion.

As he seated himself, the history teacher, Mr. Clark Wildworks, had a new, strange expression on his face. 

“Hello class,” He greeted everyone. “Today, we have not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 new classmates. The school in Montaz- a town a few towns away- had flooded, and most of its students had joined this school. So please give them a warm welcome.”

He gestured towards the door, and four animals walked in.

“Please, introduce yourselves to our very fine class.” Wildworks smiled.
[[File:Karma.png|thumb|Karma]]
The oldest looking one, a male, dark blue and brown arctic wolf stepped forward. “I am Karma Midnighthaze, pleased to be here.” There was an edge to his tone.

The class greeted him, and he sat on one of the newly placed chairs in the back.
[[File:Chris.png|thumb|Chris]]
“I’m Chris Luckyground,” another arctic wolf stepped up, with red fur, and then sat down beside Karma. 
[[File:Owenn.png|thumb|Owenn]]
Then a blue arctic wolf stepped up to the class, and cheerfully beamed, “Hey guys! I am Owenn Luckystyle- he/him.”

''What is up with these arctic wolves?'' Kai thought skeptically. Yes, he was an arctic wolf, but it was a little confusing. Must’ve been a racist friend group.

Then, the last arctic wolf stepped up. She seemed so familiar to Kai, but he couldn’t place it. She was pink, darker pink, and white.
[[File:Cornelia.png|thumb|Cornelia]]
“Hello everyone!” She said positively. “I’m Cornelia Afterlight!”

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/big&gt; ==
Kai stared at her in disbelief. He suddenly remembered her, their friendship, her disappearance without telling him, the anger he felt, all at the same time. Once, he convinced himself that she never existed, which was the final blow, into his darkness period.

All of the new arctic wolves sat next to each other in the back. 

He kept looking over at the new classmates throughout the class, not just because his long lost best friend was over there, but he kept feeling like that group itself was watching him. He tried to convince himself he was just being suspicious, as he always was, but something wasn’t right.

After a while, the bell rang, and as soon as everyone, including Kai, left the class, he got up to Cornelia, and latched on to her arm. She curiously looked at him, then asked, “Kai? Kaing Blamecar, is that you?”

He didn’t know how to feel, or what to do, except just to nod his head yes.

“I knew it! Do you remember me? I’m that little g-” Before she could finish her sentence, Kai interrupted, “I know. I still remember you from all those years ago. Why’d you leave? What happened?” He felt anger rising inside of himself, but he needed to ask that first.

Cornelia looked surprised, then responded, “Why don’t we talk about this in the cafeteria? It’s lunchtime.”

Kai wanted an answer ''now''. Not when she could run off on him again, but the look in her eyes told him something. He wasn’t sure what it was, but he just nodded.

“Great. See you there,” Cornelia seemed relieved for some reason, but then stared at Kai’s paw gripping onto hers. “Uh, could you…?”

Still shocked with confusion, he let go of her arm, and she zoomed off into the crowd of kids. He tried to see where she was going, but the crowd was too thick.

Later, he went to his locker and searched for any cigarettes he might’ve thrown in there. No luck. Then he made his way into the cafeteria, where he was surprised to see that Cornelia already got her food, and was eating at a table with those arctic wolves from earlier. Yep, must’ve been a racist friend group.

He waited in line, hoping not to be noticed by her, until he got all his food, which was peas, hash browns, and chicken- or at least, he hoped it was chicken. Although it had a green tint to it and smelled horrible.

Then, he walked up to the wolves’ table, and was immediately noticed by Cornelia.

“Oh, hey, Kai!” She smiled. “Please, sit with us.”

He felt a little suspicious of her  friendliness, but then sat down next to her and the light blue arctic wolf, Owenn.

“Um, I’m Kai.” He said bluntly.

“Hey, Kai.” The others responded with, unblinkingly, and somewhat carefully.

That somewhat unnerved him. What was going on?

“So, me and Kai were best friends when we were little,” Cornelia spoke up, then everyone began eating whilst paying attention. “That was, until… That thing happened.”

“What’s 'that thing'?” Kai asked, staring right into her eyes.

“Well,” She looked cautiously into Karma’s eyes. “I had to go away. My parents didn’t think we belonged there- well, here.”

Now, he really wanted to talk to her in private.

“Why didn’t you say goodbye? Or at least told someone where you were going? Or, hell, left me a f**king note?!” Kai felt that betrayal all over again. Not even he himself thought it was worth getting himself worked up over, but he ''had'' to say something.

Cornelia looked to the floor, a sad expression on her face, “I didn’t want to see you hurt… I know, I know, it was stupid, but…”

After a few moments, Karma put his paw on her shoulder, stared deep into her ocean blue eyes, then changed the subject, “So, what’s it like here?”

Kai paused for a few seconds, then answered, “The teachers are world class idiots, the food is sh*t, and there’s no shortage of mindless b*tches.” 

Owenn laughed, and commented, “That’s how it was at our school, too!”

No one else laughed, and then Owenn randomly asked, “So, Kai, what’s your favorite song to ever exist?”

Kai gave him a “seriously?” look, “What does that have to do with anything?”

“Oh, because you can tell a lot about a person just by their favorite song.” Owenn replied. “For me, my favorite song is ‘Roar’, by the queen Katy Perry.”

“If it matters that much to you, it’s ‘Bad Reputation’ by Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts.” Kai exasperatedly answered.

As he was watching Cornelia, he saw her put her head on Karma’s shoulder, and he put his arm around her.

For some reason, that upsetted Kai. He could’ve sworn he never had a crush on her, but inside, he was seething with jealousy.

“Hey, uh, I gotta go now.” Kai looked at the watch on his wrist, got up, and threw the food he had away in the trash bin. Well, it was just the chicken left. And he was convinced it had been infected by something. 

Throughout the school day, he kept trying to avoid that group of arctic wolves… But they seemed to have every single class he had. Jamaasian? Yes. Critical Thinking? Yes. Guitar Class? Yes. *** **? Yes.  But since in Jamaa every class is only 30 minutes long, unlike on some planet where they are unnecessarily long, he was free to go around 2:00 PM, and when that group all went outside, Kai approached them.

They were all at a wooden table that had 6 chairs shaded under a tree, talking, but Kai couldn’t hear what they were saying until he approached them.

He saw Karma, who was facing him, kick the top of the table with his foot, probably signaling the others someone was coming.

“Ok, what the hell is up?” Kai demanded, with his arms crossed. 

“Oh, hey, Kai! Surprised to see you h-” Owenn got cut off by his growl, “How the f**k do we have the same classes? At the same time? More importantly, how’d you convince the teachers to let you guys *have* the same classes at the *same* time?”

“Well, it-” Chris was cut off by Karma’s counter.  “That’s none of your business, is it?”

“I see how it is. I know something is up with you four. And I’ll make it my business to find out.” Kai growled again. Just as he was about to turn around, Cornelia spoke up. “Wait! Just sit down with us.”

Now we’re getting somewhere. Kai thought, as he sat down next to Chris.

“Cornelia, do you really think it’s time? Are we sure about this?” Karma asked her. 

“About what?” Kai butted in again. 

“Yes…” Cornelia nodded. “Now’s the time. We can’t wait until tomorrow.”

“About what?” Kai pushed.

“Well, in a way, we’re not here just because our old school got flooded.” Karma began to explain. “A few months ago, in January, there was a prediction that a curse, dated back to the Appondalian Empire, would activate this year. You see, the curse was that an unspecified amount of arctic wolves would get supernatural powers from the inactive god Juno, on the night of their 18th year of living, these few being called Delupus. It was Juno’s way of saying “f**k you” to the other animal gods for destroying him. He designed these wolves for chaos and the destruction of Jamaa. And, there is an ancient map that has mystical, red dots on where both the pre-activated and activated Delupus are, and this morning, we found out that there was a pre=activated one right in this very school.”

There was a silence that was too loud between the five of them.

“And what do you mean by that?” Kai asked too casually. He never believed in the gods, so this was nothing to him.

“Don’t you see?” Chris urged, as if it was too obvious. “You’re the Delupus we found.”

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/big&gt; ==
“Right…” Kai wanted to withdraw himself from that conversation. “And you think I’m gonna believe your f**ked up fairytales? Or, what next, Mrs. Santa Claus is Sir Gilbert in drag?”

“First of all, don’t be too sure,” Owenn responded. “And, you can not believe us now, but in around, say, 5 hours, you’ll start to hallucinate, like, horribly, and then, in whatever hallucination you have, you’ll eventually kill yourself. Then, at midnight, tonight, you’ll feel, quote unquote, reborn. And then you will get a certain, unique power.”

After a few moments of silence, Kai wanted to know what drug Owenn- well, the whole group, was on.

“It’s true.” Cornelia spoke up. “When I was hallucinating, I thought everyone around me was shriveling up from sickness except for me, and I ended up accidentally killing myself. Turns out, I am immune to any sickness or disease.”

“Wait, so you guys are saying that you are Delupus? Delupuses? Delupusi- anyways, you have fun in your sh*tty land of make believe.”

Just as he was turning, he heard Chris whisper to Karma, “So, Plan B? We don’t want this to happen like when I was activated.”

Before Kai could question that, Karma pulled out a dart gun, and shot him in the neck. Kai fell to the ground, almost immediately as he lost consciousness.

About an hour later, his mind was waking up again. He was laying on a soft surface, probably a couch, with a horrible headache. However, he overheard a conversation. 

“I bet 50 sapphires that he will try to escape somehow.”

“Seriously? I’m not betting against you.”

“Yeah, yeah, anyways, do you think he believes us?”

“Honestly, nope. If anything, he thinks we’re a cult, or escapees from a mental institution.”

“Haha, I’d think that too.”

Kai heard someone approaching him. 

“Oh, he’s still asleep.”

It was Cornelia’s voice. She was up against his head, probably on her knees.

“I’ll go get the taser and water.” Karma’s voice responded.

“OK I’M AWAKE, GOD.” Kai shot up, glaring at Cornelia, who backed up a little. 

He saw all the arctic wolves from earlier staring at him. From his surroundings, he guessed he was in a house, as he was in the living room with Cornelia &amp; Karma, while Owenn &amp; Chris were in what appeared to be a kitchen, making their way to them, then sitting down on the living room  furniture.

“Yay, he’s conscious.” Owenn made his way to them.

“SERIOUSLY? KIDNAPPING?” Kai lashed out in anger.

“You wouldn’t come with us, so…” Cornelia explained.

“And besides, you’d want to be in a safe area when you, well, turn.” Karma said as he sat on the couch, next to Kai. “So far, do you feel… strange? Seeing anything out of the ordinary?” 

''Hmm, maybe I’m surrounded by 4 idiots who think I’m some mystical creature?'' Kai thought spitefully, but just said, “No.”

He thought for a minute. Ever since he knew about this, only Cornelia said that she couldn’t get sick. But what about the others? Why haven’t they shown him their powers, if they’re telling the truth?

“I’m sure you’ve got quite the questions,” Karma asked, as if he was reading his mind. “Why don’t we see if we can answer them?”

Right on cue. Kai thought.

“Well, if you are what you say you are- demiwolves? Direwolves?-”

“Delupus.” Chris corrected.

“Yeah, that,” Kai continued. “Why haven’t any of you shown me your abilities?”

Karma answered, “We didn’t have enough time, would you like to see them now?”

Kai nodded doubtfully, then Karma gave a signal to Chris. 

He got up, and held out his paw.

Kai was confused for a second, then he was amazed to see that a beautiful, glowing fire was slowly rising out of Chris’ paw. It looked as if it could blend in to Chris’s red fur, if they were in a bright room.

“How did you…” Before Kai could finish his sentence, Owenn, who was sitting behind Chris, splashed water at his inflamed paw.

“Hey-” Chris gave Owenn a friendly smile as he turned back to him.

Before Chris could do anything more, water came flowing out of Owenn’s paw, like a high pressured hose, and hit him in the face.

“How is this even possible?” Kai said in amazement, trying to see if they were tricking him, by looking in their sleeves for anything, such as wires.

“Because,” Karma stared deeply into his eyes. “It’s supernatural; strictly from the god, Juno.”

“Okay, so Cornelia is immune to sickness, Chris has fire, Owenn has water, what do you have?” Kai asked, still kinda shocked that magic- gods- exist.

“I can walk in others’ dreams,” Karma answered. “In fact, I tried walking in yours, but you weren’t dreaming of anything.”

“Wait,” Kai looked around the room, a little confused. “How is Chris red, and has fire, Owenn is blue and has water, and you are a midnight-y color, and can do that?”

Karma let out a soft chuckle, “Sometimes, Juno creates other’s color patterns to fit their power.”

“How is Juno dead, but somehow is still creating you… creatures?” Kai asked.

“Well, in the place where all the unborn arctic wolves are, which is eternal, contains all the ones he created when he was alive, with a very, very small amount being future Delupus.” Karma explained, still making direct eye contact.

“And is this… All of you?” Kai asked, looking at everyone in the room.

“All the ones that are alive,” Owenn said, staring at the floor. Kai could see regret in his eyes.

Before Kai could ask another question, Cornelia answered it for him. “The other school we were at, the one that flooded, 2 of us died there.” She then sat up next to the couch, holding Karma’s paw. He looked like he was reliving a terrible, sad memory.

“And, throughout this year, we’ve seen a few more, but most died only hours after they turned.” Chris added.

“What were their names?” Kai asked curiously. 

Before anyone answered, Karma got up and walked out of the room, and Cornelia followed him, trying to get him to come back.

They was silent for a minute, then Chris sat on the couch next to Kai, with Owenn on the other side, and responded in a low voice, “The 2 that died in the flood’s names were Maren and Castiel… And the others were named Foreign, Mintonia, Clownar, Fence, Courage, Rodeo, Smoke, and Heaven.”

“Karma and Heaven were a thing, I believe.” Owenn made sure both Karma and Cornelia were out of earshot, and besides, the walls looked thick. “Her power was to change texture, and she tried to turn into the wind, but she got ripped apart by the air currents. Then he met Cornelia a few weeks later, and now they’re dating.”

“And honestly, I wouldn’t ship th-” Kai looked at Chris, to see why he was cut off, but he wasn’t. Chris was still talking, but Kai couldn’t hear anything. 

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/big&gt; ==
He looked to Owenn, but he was paying attention to Chris.

“What the f…” Kai drifted off, as soon as he could hear Chris talking again.

“-and I think Cornelia is tired of his-” Chris was cut out again, but then he looked to Kai, and just from reading his jowls, he could make out that Chris was asking him, “Are you ok?”

“No, I can’t hear you.” Kai shook his head. 

Chris gave Owenn a concerned look, then Owenn raced out of the room.

He looked back over to Chris, but he wasn’t there. 

“Uh, Chris?” Kai called his name, starting to feel concerned. He got off the couch, to see Owenn returning with Karma. 

“Where did Chris go?” Kai asked, but then realized it was useless.

Karma grabbed his shoulders, and started talking, as if he was yelling. Then, he could hear him, and he yelled, “You’re beginning to hal-”, and he was cut out again. Kai felt his own heart racing, as he noticed Owenn wasn’t there anymore. Kai tried to release himself from Karma’s strong grip, but Karma started pushing him into a different room. He saw Chris right behind him, as if he just magically reappeared.

“He shouldn’t be hall - ating just yet! Ka - are you gon - in the cellar-” He heard Cornelia’s voice cut in and out, yet she was nowhere in sight.

Suddenly, he couldn’t see Karma’s arms around him anymore, yet somehow, he was still being pushed.

Then, a door opened on his left, as if by itself, and he was shoved into the room, with the door supposedly closing itself. 

“F**k!” Kai yelled, as he tripped over wooden stairs, which led him to a cellar, full of wine, preserves, canned food, and books. It was dimly lit, but he couldn’t find the source of light. He stumbled, but got back onto his feet. His head was spinning, but he tried to find his way through the room. Then, a wall, full of preserves on his left, disappeared. He jumped back a little, but then tripped over a broken wine bottle, and fell onto a pile of broken glass. Screams of agony sounded like they came from upstairs, when he was screaming himself. Though, as he stopped screaming, more shrill screams joined in, like a drill pounding into his ears. He put his paws over his ears to block out the noise, but it didn’t do anything. Then, he looked down at his shins, and noticed they weren’t there anymore, and his thighs were quickly fading. He tried to get away from whatever he thought was making him turn to air, but he just bumped into a wall of trays, and a bottle got knocked over, and hit his head.

He screamed louder in pain, grabbing the bottle and throwing it at the ceiling, which backfired, as it landed on his chest and broke, covering his shirt in red wine. He then leaned up against a beam, which was only a few feet away from the wall of trays, and he looked up at the ceiling, and triangular shards of glass were falling, right onto him. Kai tried to move, but he couldn’t, and so the shards pierced through his face, collarbone, shoulders, and chest. He let out a ferocious scream, and tried to remove the shards from his face, but they broke in half, leaving the other half still in his flesh. Then, just to his horror, the floor broke, and started to cave in. He made more of an effort to move this time, yet he still could not. Then, the floor underneath him started cracking, and everything started rumbling, preserves and wine bottles exploding everywhere, as if they were sticks of dynamite. He was sprayed with more glass, and just as he was able to move his legs, the floor beneath him gave in, and he started to fall into a deep, dark pit.

Kai looked up, and noticed some glass started to fall in, as well, as if it was chasing him. He looked back down, and hit a giant, dark pit of water. The surface tension contracted the muscle in his right arm, and he closed his eyes. However, he knew there was movement all around him. Rough skin brushed up against his back and legs, followed by a fin bumping into his stomach. Kai knew what it was, but he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes. Then, a single clear thought entered his mind: get to the surface. He swam upwards with his left arm, but as soon as he thought he was just above the water, his paw hit cement. There was no way out. He opened his eyes, looked behind himself, and saw a white shark, and it sunk its bloodstained teeth into his chest and stomach, biting off all of his insides. He sank down, and about 5 other sharks finished off his floating, dead body.

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/big&gt; ==
After a few hours, Kai woke up, with a giant headache. The sharks and water were nowhere to be found, as he was still in the dimly lit room, his clothes were dry, and everything was organized neatly, as it was before anything happened.

“The hell…” Kai grunted, as he pushed himself up, and messaged his head. He noticed that his heart was gradually beating faster, but he was confused as to what just happened.

“Hey.“ A female voice sounded from the corner of the room. Cornelia.

“What just happened?” Kai demanded, though the fierceness wasn’t there due to the headache.

“You were hallucinating, and your heart stopped. Don’t worry, it happens to most Delupus.” She explained as she neared him, but Kai backed up a little.

“What? I can’t sit next to you?” She sarcastically remarked as she sat next to him, but Kai still didn’t say anything.

“Ok, well, do you feel any different?” She asked, facing Kai. As he thought about it, he did in fact feel stranger, but it hurt his head to even think.

“Yeah, but…” Kai drifted off, as he rubbed his forehead.

“Pounding headaches are also normal after 1st death, don’t worry,” Cornelia reassured him.

“First death?” Kai asked, casting upon her a sidelong glance.

“Yeah, I mean, at least we call it that. You die, you see a glimpse of your destination, possibly Juno, and then you come back to life.” She explained in a kind manner.

“Uh huh,” Kai rubbed his eyes. “Why don’t you-” He opened his eyes again, and Cornelia started to look around the room confusingly.

“Whatcha looking for?” Kai asked, getting closer to her.

“Kai? Kai! KAI?!” Cornelia got up and started searching the room.

“What’s wrong?” He sighed, but as he got up and walked towards her, it was as if she was ignoring him. Cornelia frantically raced down every aisle of preserves and bottles, shouting his name, and then raced to the upstairs door and hit it twice.

“Ok, y’all done in there?” Kai heard Chris’s voice ask.

“No, he escaped somehow!” She answered quickly.

As Chris was locking the door, Kai raced up behind Cornelia, and as soon as he opened the door to let her out, Kai raced out, accidentally tripping both of them.

“What the hell was that?” Chris exclaimed.

Kai didn’t bother to hear the rest of their spat, so he searched for a door that possibly led out of the house.

Suddenly, an alarm started blaring, both Owenn and Karma, who were sleeping, met up with Cornelia and Chris.

“I’ve got to get out of here,” Kai muttered to himself. Then, he found the door to the front porch… But, to his luck, it was locked. He looked around the area for a key, but there wasn’t one anywhere. That was, until Kai saw the group entering the room he was in, so he had an idea. 

He began hitting the door with his fist, which got their attention, but before he could move, he noticed a key around Karma’s belt. It was small, and he thought it could fit.

Carefully, he went up to him, but before he could do anything, Owen suggested that Kai might’ve been outside, so Karma raced to the door and unlocked it. Kai ran through them, pushing Owenn and Cornelia over, and breathed in a gasp of fresh air as soon as he hit outside.

Keeping it brief, he started running away from the house, but the address- “JT-D13-10754” (Which meant Jamaa Township, District 13, Area Number 10754), was seen visibly by their mailbox.

From the looks, it was like they lived in a cul-de-sac, and fortunately, he recognized this area, as the school bus he takes goes here every day.

In the dark, he followed the asphalt road, thinking about what just happened. ''So, I’m invisible? How is that- ANY of that, even possible?''

For a few minutes, these questions bothered Kai, until a bus was heading his way. He waved at it to stop, but the bus kept going, then he reminded himself that he was invisible, but this gave him an idea.

He only had to wait a few seconds for a slow paced car to come his direction, so as soon as it went by, he grabbed the door of it, then flung himself onto the back window. Fortunately, the car driver hadn’t noticed him, and they were headed to town.

== &lt;big&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/big&gt; ==

But be careful , as you don't know if a groomer, or hacker could be on the other side. be limited on what you say, and the information you share.




Stay anonymous , and you will be much safer online. Internet safety has been an issue for a long time, groomers find it easiest to manipulate children into doing horrible things. And they are everywhere, likely including this site...


And if you are underaged, and on here.. yes you may not be groomed, but you are exposing yourself to topics that are not so appropriate, thus grooming yourself in a way. 




examples of how a predator would manipulate you..



Lets say it was a sunny happy day. and you hopped on to this site to make some freinds! and you make one. Over time you guys become very close , and decide to tell eachother's ages, and names! so you go first and say.. Im 12! " then he goes on to say.. Im 14!  ...... But in reality he is a 46 year old man who wants to groom you...These people will lie about their ages so that you trust them more! ........ Some time later he ends up grooming you. ( i cant be too specific lol) .. And he made you send a picture that was... Well bad, and he threatened to blackmail you if you don't send more. Eventually this problem will escalate..... 


you don't know who's on the other side....



I wanted to write this for awareness purposes, as i have been groomed, and have survived SA myself, I think its important for others to avoid the situation..  




if you every feel uncomfortable please tell anyone! if you cant tell your parents, or a trusted gaurdian, you may want to 

tell one of the moderators, or a freind...



For help 

* Never share your age. age range may be fine, but never your age.
* your location/ area must never be shared. obvious reasons )
* never say something personal.

DO NOT SEND ANYTHING INAPROPRIATE! 


do's 

* share pictures that do not show you.
* say things that don't correspond to your home life.

share things about your state! ( if your comfortable..)



Stay safe! sorry for grammar issues)

Cressida looked at the ceiling, and then the wall. She was drenched in sweat, and had just taken another nap- Fourth this day. After two days, homework had piled up. She'd done a ''lot'' of spells that day, and was almost at full strength, but in order to go back to class, she needed to rest a little more. Turns out, her old parents had probably been draining her- The downside of being placed in such a bad situation was that as your mood dropped, so did your magic.

== Major Swaggy Swag ==
My little brother was obsessed with Animal Jam. He played it every day after school. Sometimes, I'd find him in his room with his Ipad, in the middle of the night, on what he said was an "adventure" with his buddies.

I have never known my parents. I was raised by my grandmother, who was a widow. She adopted my little brother when I was a little over 13 years old. He was 3, and when my grandmother passed 5 years later, I was the only one left to take care of him.

It was near Halloween by the time I noticed how much effort he had put into his Animal Jam account. ''If only he grinded this much in his studies'', I thought. He had over 65 animals that he each decorated with a special style and name. He had a unique outfit for every animal, and possessed many rare pets. He was friendly with every jammer he met, and always accepted buddy requests.

I thought nothing out of the ordinary would come out of his addiction to the game, after all, it was something for kids. There wouldn't be anything dangerous right?

The more he stayed up, the more I became concerned. Prominent eye bags and drooping posture due to his lack of sleep just kept getting more noticeable. His report card came in, and I saw that he was failing some of his classes. 

I confronted him and we got into a fight. He screamed when I tried to take his Ipad away, and he refused to listen to what I had to say. He locked me out of his room, and for the rest of the night, I could only hear the faint Jamaa Township music coming from his room. I couldn't let him do this. He was ignoring everything in his life to play this game.

I had never told him the truth. My grandmother had late-stage lung cancer. She knew she was going to die. She only adopted him after she witnessed my uncle and his wife fight, and watched helplessly as he shot a bullet through my aunt's head. He was an alcoholic and had been in rehab for several years. After he came home, he repeatedly beat his family until the incident happened. Seeing my brother push everything else away from him to focus on a game was like watching him overdose on drugs without doing anything. I knew I had to stop it.

I downloaded the Animal Jam Classic app and created a wolf named "Fierce Arcticbuddy" to find out what he was up to. Luckily, I knew his username. I sent him a jag asking to be "buddies". He agreed, and I went to his den.

I was caught off-guard. There were 8 people with him in his den, and all of them looked experienced and rich.

"That's a noob!" A chat bubble appeared above an arctic wolf with no eyes.

"Did you seriously buddy a New Jammer?" A purple legendary eagle said.

"We don't want them here! Lock them out and unfriend them or we're leaving!" A giraffe with multiple black spiked collars chatted, circling my brother's animal.

I was locked out and unbuddied. My brother sent me a jag, saying "I'm sorry, maybe we can hang out some other time?" I was furious. The people in his den had interfered with everything, and I didn't know what to do. I still couldn't let him destroy his school life by playing video games all day. Tomorrow was Halloween, and I couldn't let him throw that aside to play Animal Jam!

The next day, I was surprised to find him with 8 friends, the same number of people that were hanging out with him in Animal Jam yesterday. They all looked suspicious. I had never seen them around town before.

"I have to supervise you guys. My brother's 8. He can't go alone."

"But they're my best friends!" he protested, "I swear I won't get into trouble!"

I observed his so-called friends. They wore crazed expressions, like a clan of hyenas ready to pounce on a piece of prey. "It's not about you. Sometimes, trouble comes along when you least expect it." My brother bit his lip and didn't argue. I felt satisfied. "Now then, which neighborhood are you guys going to go to?" I asked.

"Let's go this way!" One of my brother's friends yelled. All the other children ran after him, and my brother trailed behind, "Major Swaggyswag, wait up!" he yelled.

My heart stopped and I looked down at my brother. I had made an Animal Jam account before. The animal names were always formatted a certain way: a 1-word adjective and an adjective combined with a noun to form a single word. Had he been hanging out with these people? Why hadn't he just met them in school if they were from this town?

I ran to catch up to my brother, only to see him disappear into a dark alleyway near Manor Street. Before I could see what was going on, I heard my brother make a high-pitched, unearthly scream and I heard his friends cackle deviously.

I saw the boy known as Major Swaggyswag bite my brother on the neck with unnaturally long and sharp teeth. My brother's skin was ripped off, and I watched tears fall from his face as the boys mutilated him. "I'm sorry," he mouthed to me, and then I watched the creatures drive their claws deep into his skin and devour his blood-soaked insides. A red puddle was spilling over the concrete pavement, and I gazed in horror as the last breath left his body, and his head thudded to the ground.

I was frozen in fear. The boys threw his body in a nearby dumpster and started advancing toward me. I ran as fast as I could, toward the police department where I knew I'd be safe.

As I tried to take a shortcut through my neighbor's yard, I found myself cornered by all 8 boys, who now resembled the demons I had been terrified of when I was a small child. Their mouths moved as they smiled unnaturally wide, and I could see every sharp, triangular tooth. They crept toward me with their needle-like fingers, which were still covered with the blood of my little brother.

Major Swaggyswag lunged at me, and I felt unreal pain as it cut my flesh into pieces. The grass smelled like metal, and my body was paralyzed in place. All my memories flashed in my mind, and I didn't have the strength to even breathe. I don't know what happened after I blacked out, but I know my body would be subject to the same fate as my brother's.

Uh... the end?

(idk how to end this sorry guys lmfao)

[[File:Ghjhgfdghjkj.png|thumb|the bunny i saw... (srry i dont have a solid to make this image, donate to epox)]]
it was a normal day in jamaa, as i was trading as usual. a weird bunny had caught my eye. it was a nonmember bunny, but somehow had a black spike on? i was so confused.  ''why does a nonmember have member items?'' i brushed it off and went to my den and decided to host a fashion show. after advertising, coincidentally the bunny came. ''why is it here? atleast i have another player....''  

While going through as normal, saying themes, choosing winners, but as i went along i saw the bunny had many spikes, leap year items, and member things including the store ones.

At the last round, and mind you the prize is a den beta, i had a hard time choosing the winner. I chose the other jammer and the bunny left immediately. ''did they ragequit? i guess they did.'' While in the pillow room, trading, etc. i saw the bunny everywhere i went. They had the den beta i had displayed on trade i could of sworn i gave to the other person.

Later, i got a jag saying from the winner saying i never traded them the den beta. ''weird, what is going on with that bunny?'' I didnt have a spare so i gave them a clothing beta to make up for it. The same thing happened again.

Later, they tried to buddy me. ''what? is this some hacker? i cant lose my account!'' i declined. They showed up at my den i locked.

"Let's be Buddies!" the bunny said over and over. I didnt think animal jam classic had bubble chat like in play wild.. ''weird.'' "what do you want?? my pixels?? why try to hack me for pixels?" i had said. Then i got logged out.

after trying to log back in, it said account not found. i checked my alt and searched my username. It wasnt there. ''what did the bunny do??''

==== it was a normal day in jamaa, and they released a new animal. It was a lop bunny. I regret logging in that day ever since. ====
[[File:The bun.png|thumb|this bunny but playable in animal jam classic not play wild]]
i was an ecstatic 8 year old excited to log onto animal jam. I saw they added a new nonmember animal, a lop bunny. it cost gems and due to contanst grinding i had 10k gems. The animal only cost 3000. My little self thought it was a good idea to get the new animal. 

i purchased it and tried it out. i was so happy! finally a new animal had arrived and i could actually use it. As i went to my den, and after some trading, tried to redecorate it. I had no items. 

It was weird, and i started to freak out because i had about 200 of them or more. i checked my animal and it had no items except a knife, which is unreleased. i stepped away from my computer as the bunny switched animals, it unmerged and i was my only other animal, the wolf. i started spamming actions until i saw they had changed. The bunny was wielding the knife at my wolf, and i did one of the actions out of bite, claw, try to escape, and give up. I chose claw and blinded the bunny for a second and ran off. i never logged into animal jam ever again.</text>

PANDA: (to the tune of I Like Candy) 🎶I’M A PANDA AND I’M HERE TO SAY I’M A PANDA SO YOU SHOULD LIKE M- 🎶

(Director enters the stage on purpose. He will leave in a few moments)

Director: No, no, no. YOU NEED TO SAY, “I LIKE TO JAM” AND SING TO THE TUNE THE SCRIPT GAVE TO YOU

PANDA: Oh.

PANDA: 🎶I’M A PANDA, AND I LIKE TO JAM🎶

Director (off-stage): (whispers) kids are here!

WOLF: 🎶I’m Mr. Wolf and-🎶

ARCTIC WOLF: That’s my line!

Director: That’s Arctic Wolf’s line.

(he runs off)

ARCTIC WOLF: (out of tune) 🎵 I’m Mr. Wolf and I am em-🎵

Director (off-stage): That’s for song six!

ARCTIC WOLF: 🎶o. Zios is our favorite man and Mira abandoned us so tell your kids that they should start getting on the computers, go to the Mira statue and spam fire, cause this is the story of Jamaa, and the story of the alphas, and the story of Mir-🎶

(Panda and Fox hold hands)

Although Zios and Mira are gone, we still with their spirit UNLIKE THIS MORON!🎶

I was in a fashion show, and I was winning. At the time, I was known on AJPW as a good outfit creator among my group of 50+ buddies that had been built over the years. The prompt was phantom. I put on my blackout spike - purple rare forest gauntlets until suddenly my screen froze. It unfroze and I was wearing a whiteout spiked collar, ( I didn’t have one ). My whole outfit had white items, including the gauntlets. My eye color was set to pure white. My animal changed from a snow leopard to a sabertooth. I freaked out so I talked to the den owner. Atleast, I tried to.

The host’s name was changed to DogCat. They were also a pure white sabertooth, just like mine but without the items. All the den items in the den were gone. My opponent in the fashion show was gone. The den was changed into a small house with a single item. A purple trendy pillow. I left the den into Jamaa Township. No one was there. I checked Sarepia Forest. Nothing. My buddies were removed. My items were gone, all but a whiteout spiked collar and rare forest gauntlets which I realized were the impossible color of white. I tried to turn of my device. I even tried to shut it off. I went as far as to break my device… 

…Until I realized I was too late.

== Chapter 2: DogCat ==


What happened to my fashion show? And, am I my AJPW character? Am I one with the game? What is this stone cave? Why has my avatar changed to a fully white sabertooth? I barely remember what happened before I came here. It was the last round of a fashion show. No, MY fashion show. PawLaw725 against Silverdragon001. Then, I changed. I can only remember two things after that. 

DogCat, DogDess, DogCat.


And voices. I don’t know what they were saying.



WHO IS THAT

== Chapter 1: Time to Learn. ==
It was a magnificent day in Crystal Sands, and the atmosphere was electric with thousands of animals partying and having a blast. Floral, a cute little snow leopard, was still in her bed, snuggled up in her cozy blanket when her alarm clock rang at 7:00. She flung her arms to turn it off, but in her grogginess, she accidentally smacked it, sending it flying across the room. "Oops, sorry, little buddy," she muttered, giving it a little pat before hopping out of bed. 

As she walked over to her mirror, she couldn't help but chuckle at her morning hair, which looked like a bird's nest. "Time to tame this beast," she thought, grabbing her comb and getting to work. But just as she started brushing, she noticed a shadowy figure lurking outside her window. It was a proto-phantom, and it looked like it was about to attack! Without a second thought, Floral sprang into action. She raced towards the window, ready to slam it shut. But just as she was about to reach it, the phantom lunged forward, and she let out an ear-piercing shriek. In a split second, Floral had leapt out of her room, not even bothering to use the stairs. She flew down and landed with a thud, her heart racing.

Panting heavily, she turned around to see if the phantom was still there. But to her relief, it had vanished. She took a deep breath and laughed, realizing just how ridiculous she must have looked. "Well, that was quite the wake-up call," she thought, shaking her head in disbelief. And with that, she went about her day, ready for whatever adventures lay ahead.

Floral dragged her left foot as she made her way to the kitchen, her leg feeling sore. Her mother was busy flipping a colorful pancake, humming a tune as she cooked. When Floral spoke up, her mother turned around to give her attention. "Mom, I saw a phantom in my room!" she blurted out. Her mother's eyes widened in surprise. "What now? A phantom?" she exclaimed incredulously. Floral nodded, feeling a sense of unease creeping up on her once again. "Yes, a phantom. A proto-phantom," she said, trying to sound calm and collected. Her mother paced around the kitchen, her attention now divided between her daughter and the pancake that was starting to burn.

Just then, there was a loud knock on the door, interrupting their conversation. "I'll get it!" Floral cried out, eager to see who was at the door. She rushed over to the entrance and saw a note being slipped into the house through the door slip. Her curiosity piqued, she picked up the note and quickly scanned its contents. "What does it say?" her mother asked, now fully focused on her daughter. "It says I'm one of thousands that are invited to an Alpha Training Academy school!" Floral exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Class starts today at 10:00!" Before her mother could even reply, Floral darted off to her room, still reeling from the news. She opened up her closet and scanned through her clothes, finally deciding on a plaid skirt and her favorite princess necklace. "Ooooh! I look fancy!" she exclaimed, striking a pose in front of her mirror. She then made her way downstairs, where her mother had prepared a delicious breakfast of pancakes and bacon. "Wow, that's perfect!" her mother exclaimed, beaming with pride. She then added a little blue, purple, and pink bow to Floral's hair, ensuring that she looked her best for her big day. 

"Perfect! I'll pack your stuff and you can eat," her mother said, already getting started on packing Floral's bag. She made sure to include all the essentials - notebooks, pencils, books, and anything else that Floral might need. When Floral finished her meal, they chatted for a bit until it was time to leave. "Bye, mom!" Floral said as she slung her backpack over her shoulder. She walked out the door and hopped onto the waiting bus, eager to start her new adventure.

== Chapter 2: First Day ==
Floral gazed out of the window, her eyes full of excitement and anticipation. The bus had finally arrived at their destination, and she could hardly wait to explore the new environment. She picked up her bag and walked down the steps, her heart racing with anticipation. As she stepped off the bus, she was greeted by a wolf who was running to catch up with her friend. "Wow! This has gotta be a three-story building," the wolf exclaimed, clearly impressed by the size of the structure.

As Floral was about to take her first steps toward the building, someone accidentally bumped into her. "Sorry! I'm so sorry!" a small bunny said, extending a helping paw to lift Floral up. "It's ok!" Floral said shyly, straightening out her skirt. The bunny, whose name was Lila, introduced herself as Peck's cousin. Floral was amazed by her luck in being the cousin of an alpha.

Lila grabbed Floral's paw, and they raced inside, laughing and enjoying each other's company. As they entered the building, Floral read a message that said, "Since today is your first day, you may explore. The schedule is down below."

The schedule contained a variety of classes and activities that the students could choose from. Floral and Lila decided to head to music class first, which was one of the secondary classes. They found some students making music together, including a lion, a tiger, a bird, and a wolf.

After music class, they made their way to a tertiary class, which was dedicated to trading. Lila put up an offer for a purple long spike collar, which was immediately sold for forest gauntlets. Floral traded up for a den beta, feeling excited about the possibilities that lay ahead.

Finally, it was time for the alphas to show the new students their dorms. Floral and Lila eagerly followed them, their hearts full of anticipation and excitement. Floral was shown a beautiful plant dorm with plants all around, and a bed with flower prints. Floral was so excited for her days here!

== Chapter 3: Phantom Attack! ==
It was night. Floral couldn't seem to sleep. She peeked through the blinds and saw the moon on the other side of the sky, as it was almost morning. She headed to the girls bathroom and snuck into a stall, locking it and pressing her ear to the door. She heard paw steps, and heard a group of bunnies fangirling over the new boy.  

"He's so attractive..."

"He better not be taken..."

"He's too hot to be the sun!"

Floral listened to the bunnies, hoping to spot the new boy somewhere. She snuck out of the bathroom and walked back, but she saw a black flying thing heading toward her. When it got closer, it was clear that it was a phantom, a heavy phantom. She screeched. "HELP!" As it chased her down.

== Chapter 1: I’m not an idiot ==
“You’re such an idiot!” “This conversation isn’t about you!” “Are you autistic?” Ugh. I heard those words over and over for joining someone’s conversation. And who knows it’d cause the biggest problem in Jamaa ever? It all started with me being bored. Deciding to play at Gabby’s, I crept over to some seals like me and enjoyed a nice conversation about parents. Taylor Swift, children, and the modern state of the game. Only one problem: a bunny I once knew was there. I won’t say her username, but her name tag was Green Vonalien. And what I remember: she was easily offended when it came to a certain wolf. The first time I met her was with her “friends” who were annoyed whenever she offended someone. And a wolf. The wolf and bunny seemed like each other…a lot.

Curious, I  walked over. I asked what they were doing. “None of your beeswax”, the bunny said. I shrugged. They insulted me. But the pins of rude, disrespectful words stabbed into my fur strengthened me. So that memory was gone. I said, “hey” to the bunny. She recognized me and said rude things to me. I told her to stop it like an innocent new jammer, but she just kept going, she called me an idiot and autistic. Autism is, of course, not a bad thing. But that roast…is it supposed to offend autistic people, treat them like aliens? I asked her what she meant, like if she was curious or if she meant it in a bad way, speaking of that she was against me. She had no reply and kept calling me names. Her wolf ran to her side and joined her. I didn’t honestly care back, so I minded my own business.

== Chapter 2: I’m not your girlfriend ==
The wolf was a different problem. I got unsafe vibes from him. He had a phantom beanie and dark black fur. He crawled over to me and blushed. I shrugged him off, and tried to report him. I decided blocking would be useless; he was only using emojis and not actual chat. Emojis would still show up. And that’s why later the drama started. He said, “you’re so speshal”. A red panda was concerned, and said, “It’s special. Not speshal-“ and then an argument started. When I watched people argue over how it was spelt, I was preparing to leave. When I inched toward the door, a fox asked me, “why are you leaving?”

I didn’t reply, so for the next six minutes I was bored again. I lie on the floor of Gabby’s, watching the wolf jump and do angry emojis on the red panda. Of course, the bunny was on the wolf’s side. Once the argument was over, the wolf inched toward me and blushed. That was it. I had it. This wolf was an absolute weirdo. I asked him to stop, but he didn’t. I said, “I feel unsafe.” A fox asked, why?

I murmured, trying to not hog attention, I said the wrong thing with no intention. I just meant to joke around and lighten Gabby’s up. But my words…

“Useless information. (Sparkle)”

== Chapter 3: I’m not someone loved ==
I had no idea at first what had happened, but people screamed, “hacker! Hacker!” Some were confused, and asked who. They said, “that cowboy crocodile!” I knew immediately they meant me. I tried to ask why they thought I was a hacker, but they ran in circles. So I climbed upstairs. I needed comfort from a welcoming dire wolf, but then the wolf came up and started doing “stuff” on him. He shouted hacker at me and the dire wolf as we ran. We landed near a red panda who was chilling. The bunny caught up to the wolf. People screamed, “hacker!” below.

I reasoned one more time, along with the red panda. I left before the bunny could say, “idiot!” one more time, but that’s where I gained my infamous look. I tried to go to the arctic wolf cave where my buddy was, but it was full. Still, when I clicked, “go to buddy”, without any paintbrush symbol over my crocodile’s head, I turned into an arctic wolf. This only convinced more people I was a hacker. Everyone left. Now I was alone. The bunny screamed, “hacker!” before I ran away.

I knew you don’t need someone to love you. But when you’re infamous, it’s hard getting just one good shoulder to cry on.

== Chapter 4: I’m not who you think I am ==
I had that a problem since I didn’t have too many friends growing up. But I had to prove to myself that I needed to live up to who I was alleged to be. I never hacked. I never hack. I never will hack. I didn’t do that. Instead, I learned the technique I had from running for my therapist buddy. I went to hideouts, and while the cave was still full, I clicked on it and became an arctic wolf. Albeit no response, I finally knew I was going to live in notorious light, but only for witnesses, their friends, their friends’ friends, and the people they spread it to. So not all jamaa would be able to hear, but I’d be safe with my buddies and in the fox den.

Everything was going to be alright.

On November 9th 2021 I was playing Animal Jam: Play Wild, nothing horrible or bad was happening, in fact it was a great day due to me being on a trip to my Nan’s for a few days. I decided to go to Jamaa Town for some stuff to make a oc with my Wolf. I entered the sapphire shop due to having lots of unneeded sapphires. I saw a weird item that I swear to have seen before, ‘Skullies? Isn’t that the item from the classic that was banned due to looking inappropriate on pandas?’ I questioned in my mind. Mind you, I was an p2w new player back then and didn’t know if skullies in play wild.

It was 25 sapphires, which I thought was cheap so I bought it and putted on a panda. ‘Jesus no wonder why the creators removed it.’ I thought, I didn’t want to say out loud due to my Christian grandparents being nearby, right next to the room next to me actually. I changed back to my wolf, but it didn’t look like what it should have looked like.

It was in a weird shape and not like the wolf avatar should have looked like. A short canine muzzle, long and lanky ears with a light pink flesh that wasn’t gorey, big paws and a huge bushy tail instead of being labeled wolf it was labeled ‘straydogpwtest’. I thought the name was weird but I decided to play as it, thinking I was lucky to have a test model but in reality that was a bad mistake on my part.

I started having weird in game glitches, such as lag, weird text in seemly greek letters popping up on the screen, and a buddy request by a user of Straydog with the same avatar as mine except the colours. I accepted it due to thinking their username was a random joke. I logged off for the night and went to sleep

'''November 10th 2021'''

I woke to play Animal Jam: Play Wild, excited due to hearing something about a update last night. To my disappointment I was met with a mail, I pressed the mail and heard a sad, in pain and suffering dog whine and I seen a image with a seemly stray dog with a weird thing around its neck and it seemed to be choking, I realized what it was due to seeing fox traps around my area, the poor thing was caught in a fox trap and whoever took the photo didn’t help it. Above it said ‘Look what you caused:)’ in corrupted letters. I thought it was sick how they literally put a smiley face at the end of the message. ‘ I need to unbuddy this user somehow’ I thought to myself. 

The game wouldn’t let me unbuddy them so I decided to log out of my account and never use it again. 

'''May 17th 2022'''

It’s been a while since I lost my old Animal Jam: Play Wild account due to a user named Straydog, I was thinking Straydog thought I was banned and they stopped trying to find me. I decided to go back to the sapphire shop but then seen a familiar avatar, too familiar. It was Straydog’s avatar. ‘Crap, I found them again ‘ I thought in worry, my eyes stared to the screen, nothing was moving until a thing popped up ‘Straydog would like to be your buddy’. I thought something bad would happen if I declined so I shuted down my IPad and didn’t play Animal Jam for 2 years. 

I logged back in on May 15th 2024 and my account was safe, thank god. I never seen Straydog since 2 years ago. Hopefully no one else was their victim. This is why I don’t buddy anyone anymore.</text>

This story is a tired and tried idea, but something I recently started think about and hope is enjoyable for you all!

Our tale starts with the tale of two lovers...

== Chapter One: No Longer ==
''"Always. It has always been.'' 

''"It starts in a barren wasteland, invisible to the human eye and unknown by their wielders...''

''"A deserted place protected by the magic mists of a goddess, but bearing nothing worthy of protection.''

''"-Consider yourself worthy."''

''"Apologies. You may continue. Tell your story, blinded one. Speak to me."''

''"...Thank you. Thank you very much. It starts with- with a blind man. A blind man who is blind both in physical vision and in emotion. He is void of it-- void of feelings, for he has nothing to feel, only a pinhole of the moon and the stars, oh the joy that they bring him..."''

''"He has no sense of time, for he has no people. No certainty of where, or when, or '''why''' he is from. No purpose. No purpose at all. He spends much of that timeless time, though, gazing at the everlasting azure, its blessed expanse with piercing white stars and the beautiful blue moon.''

''"He believes, has '''always''' believed that he must have a purpose in order to live--so he found himself one. His purpose became to form words to articulate the meaning of the stars and the moon.''

''"And on the day he found this belief, he opened his eyes for the first time. Truly opened them. He then saw that he could not speak these articulations, these determinations... He could not speak at all. The sounds that came from his strangled voice were sickly, pathetic, and meager.'' 

''"He needed more.''

''"So he forced himself to spend his timeless time on something- something, something, something. Forcing himself again and again to change the shape of his mouth so he could make a noise that may just be his saving grace.''

''"And he made one. The first one. A.'' 

''"And because he could not see, he spoke. He spoke every sound he could, until... He had words. Until he had a story.''

''"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...''

''"Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, eighteen, nineteen...''

''"Twenty, twenty-one, twenty, two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven. He made twenty-seven.'' 

''"He made the noises into thousands of words- thousands of words and words to define those words, millions of sounds and accents and symbols... Symbols. He spoke in symbols.''

''"Yet he did not, since what he spoke stood for nothing. '''He''' stood for nothing.''

''"He waited. It was all he had. Words.''

''"So he wrote. He wrote his empty, blinded cries into void after void. He lived in a void, the blind man. The landscape had no fruit, no flower, no fortune. The sounds became symbols. '''He''' became a symbol. For desperation.''

''"He needed to be heard. So he looked, as much as he could- once more to the moon and stars. And, miraculously, he became a '''witness''' to the light. For a moment, he could not see at all- And then. He saw The Becoming. The Becoming, The Rise, The Crowning, of the. Of '''the''' moon and stars.''

''"A burst of feathers that were lush like the oceans She would create, turquoise and teal and sapphire and azure and royal and cobalt, every shade of blue in a rainbow, an explosion- A '''supernova'''--"''

''"He saw '''hope'''.''

''"And for New Days he ran, still in desperation, but renewed for the renewable, for the promise of such, the promise of half a promise, a '''chance''' at '''real life'''--He would no longer be alone.'' 

''"No longer would he wait.''

''"He, too, would rise."''

== Chapter Two: Death, Better Than Descension ==
''"He Ascended.''

''"He ran and he ran until, quite literally, he was ascending.''

''"Across a mountain that he discovered was surrounded by the same mists--A frigid place of stone and no gold, but at its peak, where he struggled to survive, through the mists, through the unblurred dot in his view, he caught a glimpse- a '''true''' glimpse- of a staircase.''

''"The staircase was clear as the diamonds that he would be gifted with, the beauty of Ascension again. He ascended and descended, yet, for the purpose of this tale, he simply kept running, up the stairs again and again.''

''"A part of him knew they would be infinite.''

''"But one must remember what desperation does. What '''loneliness''' does.''

''"And so he kept running.''

''"He ran until a voice, the first voice he had heard other than his own, told him to '''stop'''.'' 

''"He did. The mists parted. No, it was '''his''' mists that had parted- He was not on the staircase. Never there at all. Simply an illusion. Was that his life? Instinctively, he asked the question out loud.''

''"He was surprised when the voice answered.''

''"'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''Your life is no illusion, you only have no memory. It is true that you are blind, and it is true that you are alive. Remember well, old friend.'"'''''

''"He asked again, louder this time- the voice, it was so soothing, so patient, so '''welcoming'''--surely, surely his hope was becoming truth.''

'''''"'Your life is no illusion, you only have no memory. It is true that you are blind, and it is true that you are alive. I understand you because I have watched you, because I too have heard you, because I know that you have always seen beyond the Clouding. Remember well, old friend.'"'''''

''"Clouded and no memory, but no illusion. Clouded and no memory, but no illusion. He thought to himself this same thought again and again, again and again-- he hated the phrase. The repetition.''

''"But it was far better than thinking of his meaninglessness. How pitiful he was, how gifted he was to be granted just one hearing of the voice, one small sign of companionship, of '''life'''...''

'''''"'I would never lie. I promise you. I am weary, too. You are not alone. It is true, what I say. Please... please believe me. I cannot tell you much else.'"'''''

'''''"'I... I cannot tell you more. No. You must leave. I am sorry, old friend. Please... I know you cannot, but remember me... Before they took you away..."'''''

''"The voice stopped suddenly. A crack in the glass. A slumping of shoulders. A pair of wings, deadened.''

''"He heard a new voice.''
 ''"Come now, Mira. We warned you. Do not speak to the Descended. There is a reason they cannot- they '''must''' not remember.'' 

 ''"We must do this, for the sake of our future. The Council, what will they think if they find out you've been meddling again? It is why we had to bring so much destruction in the first place. It is not our goal, Mira.'' 

 ''"Please- Please. For me. I have seen too many Descensions. Do not let me see yours. Let me rest, knowing you will make wise choices. Please."'' 

 ''"...Yes, Saul..."''


''"He knew then: He knew he was Descended. But what could that mean? He knew nothing, nothing and everything, not enough and too much.''

''"He was still human: Cursed and blessed with curiosity."''

== Chapter Three: A Petal Falls To The Ground ==
''"The blind man was cast away from the mountain. He spent what would've been New Days sleeping, sleeping, then awakening, then thinking.''

''"It was true. He could not remember anything.''

''"Why he was alone. Why he had no memories. '''How'''?''

''"He was still a symbol for desperation. He had nothing to cry into, but for the first time, without a shoulder to lean on, without '''anything''' the blind man, beyond starving, started sobbing and shaking- no. It wasn't that.''

''"There was a gust of wind.''

''"The land that had cursed him was cruel.'' 

''"He didn't know how long he had survived without food.''

''"But he was hungry.''

''"He was Descended.''

''"A petal fell to the ground.'' 

''"The blind man saw just a flicker of red in the corner- Nothing of importance.''

''"At first. But then as he reached out just barely towards it, fumbling around pleadingly for help, he bumped into something- An object. Rough and studded, plenty sturdy. A tree.''

''"He raised his paw again and again, and he felt something as he scraped up its branches, so fortunate not to have been hurt or fallen, and then- And then he was.''

''"A thorned branch drew blood from his arm.''

''"Nevertheless, he continued. The pain of his wound gripped his body with ruthless vigor, yet even then, with blood flowing from his body by the minute, he continued.''

''"He dizzied, feeling lightheaded. He reached again, and finally, he found something- A new texture. A softer one. Cradled by leaves. An apple.'' 

''"Instantly, he bit into it, chewing his heavenly bounty. It tasted vibrant, like hope itself, like a '''promise--'''''

''"Another petal fell to the ground, and the blind man fell from the tree."''

== Chapter Four: Speak Of The Heavens ==
''"Immediately, the blind man struggled to stand. He was trapped, and in terrible conditions. The stroke of dashing magenta he had seen beforehand was removed now by blood's gruesome red- dripping, dripping, dripping.''

''"He heard each drop like the roar of thunder. Like a whisper in a room full of silence.''

''"He begged and wailed for his Savior, the Voice, '''Mira''' to return to him. To '''save him''' as She had before.''

''"Yet the apple She had given him was tainted with the bitterness of blood.''

''"And then, in his deepest despair, his most excruciating moment, he remembered.''

''"He remembered the Heavens.''

''"He remembered his '''people'''.'' 

''"He had started as an ordinary man. A member of his tribe, who lived in a lush rainforest, a jungle with plants from every encyclopedia.''

''"He remembered the bonfires they held- Celebratory, joyous, and brimming with passion. He and his people '''connected''' over the flame.'' 

''"Its locks of blue, red, orange, yellow, white, gold- An ocean of opposites, all parallel, dancing with the people who surrounded it.''

''"Mangroves leaning down to offer cooling shade in the humid weather, smoke rising into the air yet with the trees unharmed, the firewood taken from twigs and logs already fallen.''

''"Emerald vines snaking their way across the undergrowth, attaching themselves to the trees and the rocks. A gurgling stream that yielded shining precious metals and bounties of scrumptious fish.''

''"He could '''see''' the '''life''' in it all.''

''"He was seeing '''his''' life.''

''"A message fell from the tree, like the petal.''

''"He could not read them.''

''"But he saw it, directly in front of him- again, he reached, staining the paper with blood.''

''"And then it spoke. No, '''She''' spoke.''

'''''"'Remember well, old friend. That is the message you must never forget. The Heavens will not allow it. But stay alive for as long as you can in what you call your timeless time, and I will try to save you.'"'''''

== Chapter Five: Blood Like Rain ==
''"And so he remembered.''

''"He remembered more, as much as he could-''

''"Until he truly did remember the Heavens.''

''"It had been pleasant, his life- luxurious, even- until the Bloodstorm. Ehekakiauitl.'' 

''"His life was simple. Roam the palaces of the Heavens, bask in glory, dine wonderfully, entertain himself, and keep quiet.'' 

''"He was nothing more than the average god. A being assigned a role and a name, then brushed away with the rest.''

''"There were thousands of gods, very few of which he had met.'' 

''"There was no '''real''' god, no single entity who was superior- there was only the Council at the very top.''

''"The Council controlled everything. They wrote and rewrote history. They were '''made''' to be in power.'' 

''"Their latest experiment had made its rounds, and became a popular product of the rumor mill.'' 

''"The blind man, Tonatiuh, was not blind at first. He heard of the rumor, and took an interest in it. He dared to venture into the Omnium, where the Council held private meetings.''

''"His role was to move the sun.'' 

''"His role was not being completed.''

''"His interruption was deemed a disturbance.''

''"So Tonatiuh was told he would be given one more chance.''

''"He would partake in the experiment.''

''"He would lead the tribe inhabiting their island.''

''"The place where blood would pour like rain."''

== Chapter Six: Immortality Is A Curse ==
''"Tonatiuh was a model. An experiment within an experiment. The Council knew what would happen.''

''"Tonatiuh did not.'' 

''"He was sent to the island with one mission: To observe the tribe's progress and development. To gauge their understanding of divinity.''

''"With speed and ease, he became their leader. The tribe loved him. They praised him alongside the moon, who they deemed their Deliverer, the Bringer Of Life.''

''"Each night, Mira would arrive and gracefully carry the moon into the sky. Tonatiuh became a true member of the tribe, worshipping Mira and the moon when nightfall came.''

''"The Council had allowed Tonatiuh to return to the Heavens with progress reports. These reports were optional and unscheduled, allowing for Tonatiuh to believe he was in control.''

''"As Tonatiuh became more accustomed to his tribe, the Council noticed that he had been returning to the Heavens less and less frequently. The detail, accuracy, and lengths of his reports declined, along with his caring for the Heavenly Order.''

''"This irritated the Council, as a god had never rejected the greatness of Heaven. But despite what others might've considered a setback, the Council was not swayed.'' 

''"Tonatiuh was expected to grow attached to humanity.''

''"That was what the tribe was, after all: Uploaded intelligence. Humanity, stripped down to psychology, then cautiously inserted into subjects. The first subjects were placed in the bodies of animals.''

''"But Tonatiuh knew nothing.''

''"He only knew their smiles and their cheers. He only knew their dreams and their desires. He only knew their fears and their anxieties.''

''"Tonatiuh did not know the truth.''

''"He thought that it would last forever, just as he would.''

''"He hadn't stopped to ask any questions.''

''"The Council held a meeting.''

''"Tonatiuh had begun to cause disruption. He forgot to push the sun across the sky. The world was dying. The '''humans''' were dying. The lab rats that the Council favorited.''

''"The Council came to a solution: They would change the direction of the experiment. Instead of a group of people isolated on the island, it would be one.''

''"The only one who could survive.''

''"Tonatiuh.''

''"So they sent a terrible plague to the island. They planted seeds for a civil war. They created an enemy tribe.''

''"Tonatiuh could not count the corpses.''

''"He was asked to send a report when the disease first broke out.''

''"So he did.''

''"As the last tribe member fell, Tonatiuh felt more than pain.''

''"He was being tortured.''

''"The Council blinded him.''

''"Tonatiuh- the blind man- woke up on the island alone. He had blacked out.''

''"After he bit from the apple, he remembered.''

''"He remembered what a bitter god, one who had grown too powerful after Descension, to the point which the Council resurrected him- Osseus was his name- had said after the Council had explained to him the terms for his staying alive.''

''"Immortality is a curse."''

== Chapter Seven: The World Is Broken ==
''"The Council's plan was as follows:''

''"Break the world into seven.''

''"Let one fraction of the earth be ascended: A utopian paradise, with a surplus of resources and endless homes of luxury. There, as long as each 'god' plays their part, no one is in vain.''

''"The second and third would be the experimental areas, reserved for humans only. The gods would watch above the humans and guide them, gift them, so they may survive. Death and destruction would be brought when needed.''

''"The fourth would be an isolated place--still for experiments, of course. A land that would be later named Jamaa, and inhabit their uploaded intelligence experiments.''

''"The fifth would be a cave. A place where human and Jamasian souls alike could roam. Gods, even. It would be infinite-Another experiment, so the Council could study the psychology of each entity.''

''"The sixth would be a digital world. Where the uploaded intelligence would go after their bodies wore out. Another experiment- an afterlife for those already in their afterlives. A question posed to society: What is immortality?''

''"The seventh would be a blank space. An ever-changing world. No one knew what or who was there, only that no one ever came back out.''

''"The Council made the decision to break the earth so that their experiments would stay separate.''

''"So that '''they''' could stay in control.''

''"One must remember that they were made trillions of years before anything else.''

''"They do not follow any timeline.''

''"They '''invented''' time.''

''"Every thought, every '''thing'''... There is no way to even know if it was '''intended''' to be a simulation.''

''"But the Seven Worlds were not the only thing that the Council broke.''

''"They tore apart '''everything''', every thousand years.''

''"Their existence is a mystery.''

''"A mystery, in their eyes, is nonexistent.''

''"The few who know about them- the Gods Of Elkyris, the Forgotten City- have been outcasted. Tortured. Captured.''

''"One survivor '''chose''' to erase his memories of what they did to him.''

''"He wrote:''

''"Their eyes are colder than winter.'' 

''"'''No,''' they have none.''

''"They are a symphony. In unison. Rehearsed.''

''"'''Made''' to invoke emotion, but hold- '''feel'''- no emotion themselves.''

''"They are perfection. Intelligence and nothing more. A cunning vaster than the seas.''

''"They? They are soldiers.''

''"I am inclined to believe they are pawns in a game of chess that we are irrelevant to.''

''"We are not even '''ants''' in the cells that the lost pieces are trapped in.''

''"The being that '''created''' them... That is what is the king.''

''"And the Council?'' 

''"Their singular goal is to protect the king.''

''"So they will break us like they have broken the world.''

''"They will break us because in reality, we are '''nothing''' in comparison."''

== Chapter 1 - It Starts Out with an Earthquake==
It was the brightest, sunniest day in Jamaa. Like any animal, Chief Deserthiker woke up, as a tiger and stretching his paws out to the dusty soil of his den. His mentor, Professor Spiritscholar, a carpenter, was watching the news on his TV. Recently, AJ made a contract with a foreign land to stream their videos on the TVs. The news anchor said, “Today was unfortunate day in Cor-“ There was a buzz in the TV. The anchor continued, but in an unstable voice, “Coral Canyyyyyyyy-“ Static broke up his words. “on. An earthquwwwww-“ More static. The TV sound suddenly went mute, with a very confused Professor. “What just happened?” he asked. Chief shrugged, but it probably wasn’t good, as the screen, soon in black-and-white, showed snakes tossing into each other as the ground rumbled. One fell into a gorge, which lava spewed out.

Chief was absolutely terrified. “Turn it off,” he yelled, “Turn it off!” Professor responded, “I’m trying! I’m trying!” The TV blacked out, only mumbles of the sound escaping. A thunder of voices sounded from their hut, disturbing the neighbors, the Chunkyvikings. The Chunkyvikings were trying to sleep in, but Professor’s endless yelps shook their house. The Chunkyvikings were eagles, so they could just fly out. But barely one another couldn’t assemble to leave. They tossed into each other, only making this hectic situation worse. The TV turned back on, with former jambassador 7nut - although it really looked like a faker - reassuring jammers that the craziness  be over soon, and that rescue helicopters and planes would come. Jammers all over Sarepia Forest were told to evacuate in case the earthquake hit this area, but the people on the news were oddly calm about that, in particular, 7nut. 

“Something’s really off,” murmured Professor, launching himself back onto the damaged couch. “These airplanes and helicopters are oddly not stopping for us.” Then the TV buzzed again. The Jamaa alarm system played - ER ER ER ER bebebebee Please Evacuate Now.

[[Category:Song Stories]]
[[Category:Fanfiction]]
''…That’s great, it starts out with an earthquake &lt;br&gt; Birds and snakes and aeroplanes &lt;br&gt; And 7nut, allegedly, is not afraid''

The two animals were struggling to pack up. The mentor, who was a kangaroo, was the one having the most trouble packing in. His suitcase could barely fit his tools. Meanwhile, Chief’s bag was missing. Could they evacuate at all? The alarm was pressuring them to leave. The tiger did what his mother told him to - to close his eyes, and not think about it. It always calmed her down. The young jammer did, but this method only proved to be worse. He could hear imaginary hurricane currents rushing in his ears. And that’s when the earthquake hit. It’s unfortunate like that, because the Chunkyvikings were taking a ladder down from their house. The ground gently shook, taking the ladder a bit wobbly. The mother and youngest were already on the ground, just as Older Brothers zipped down. Finally, the only ones in the house were Earl - the father - and Sister. Earl was rushing down the ladder as fast as he could, despite it rapidly swaying.

”You can do it, dad!” cried Sister, deciding to stay inside and find a safer option. “No! You have to come down with me!” Earl screamed, the ladder just about to topple. Professor and Chief were running downstairs to their sports car, shining in the sun. They ran inside, nervous. Professor reached for the steering wheel, noticing the Chunkyvikings were struggling to escape. “I’ll get it!” yelled Chief, running toward the ladder to help them. Yet, he couldn’t. The earthquake became so violent it slapped the tiger right into the wall, some blood spilling, along with the family. As well as Earl, who fell off the ladder as it decided to fall on him. The only one unharmed was Professor and Sister. Sister looked down, seeing the horrors. Yet, she knew in her instincts she had to stay inside.

The TVs were still playing, static sending all over. Chief got up, holding his paw to his cheek and guiding the wounded eagles, except Earl who was presumably dead, to the car. The car could barely fit them, but they managed to quickly get out of the street. Sister, still, was sitting in her shook up house, crying. She was safe, but very lonely - only her bunny plushies to comfort her. The car was bouncing in a way, as the news played from the radio. “The recent earthquake has happened yet again - the Dust Plate and Tropic plate keep crashing, but this time, it was much more violent, going as far as Point Glacier. This recently shook up the Sarepia Forest capitol, ending up in Mayor Frillytail dead.” 

Everyone paused, giving the briefest moment of silence for Mayor Frillytail, who had worked very hard to make a better world. Still, Professor was struggling to get through the traffic they encountered. That’s when the fire happened.

==Chapter 2 - Wire In a Fire==
Now, kids, never play with matches. This is what an unlucky jammer named Fierce Climbingpaw learned, but he learned the very hard way. “The government’s dead?” he grumbled, in his apartment listening to the static of the radio. “That’s means someone will have to come governor. Like me…” Fierce had already been in politics for a long time. His political rival was Alien von Teeth, and he knew as soon as the opportunity was open, he’d rush to the throne. The lion had to stop him, whatever it took. That’s when he realized he could burn down Alien’s house. Fierce thought it was the best plan ever.

Sadly, Fierce was often thought as…how do I say this, narcissistic, unaware. If he managed to take office than Alien, he would just do it for money and for healthcare. Now, about the helicopters I mentioned earlier? They were completely unaware it was this bad of a situation. And the other lands of Jamaa and the alphas didn’t seem to even ''care.'' That night, as cars pulled up to the signs on the street, the lion and his supporters were lighting torches and singing old war songs. Alien was asleep, his lemur tail curled and a big smile across his sleepy face. He was a creamy white color with a nice yellow pattern and big, soft eyes. He also listened to needs of others, but he wasn’t that experienced with international relations. A better choice than Fierce, but not the best choice, to say.

Now I know you’re going to fall in love with that description, aren’t you? No? Well, too bad. I made him survive this story…for now. The matches miss his home, but that makes the department stores and supermarkets on fire because the fire hits them. So I guess if he died, it would have saved us a lot of trouble. “On the count of three, my men,” echoed a voice, “We launch these torches, matches, and grenades onto the enemy’s house! I will become leader, and there is no stopping me!” Everyone yelled angry words, some even too angry to write. They weren’t angry at Fierce, though, they were angry at Alien. Alien woke up, startled by the noise.

1…

3…

The grenades, matches, and torches flew in the air, sticking themselves to the nearest stores. Food was now scarce. But the fire burned through the streets. Fierce yelped. “Everyone, go! Go! I’ll handle this myself!” He ran into the fire, likely trying to act heroic so he could get more followers. But the flames swept him up, burning through his blue fur. Yelps came from the fire, but his followers tried to rescue him. The fire burned them too. Walls of art soon were scorched. The fire eventually spread so quickly it reached the traffic jam. Now, about that sports car. Everyone in it was terrified.

''…Eye of the hurricane, listen to yourself churn &lt;br&gt; World serves its own needs &lt;br&gt; Don’t mis-serve your own needs &lt;br&gt; Speed it up a notch, speed grunt, no, strength &lt;br&gt; The ladder starts to cladder &lt;br&gt; With a fear of height, down, height &lt;br&gt; Wire in a fire, represent the seven games &lt;br&gt; And a government for hire and a combat site &lt;br&gt; Left her, wasn’t coming in a hurry &lt;br&gt; With the furies breathing down your neck''

==Chapter 3: Save Yourself, Serve Yourself==
We resume to the gruesome, lawless Sarepia Forest highway. Cars packed tightly together, trying to fight the fire. Chief closed his eyes, still hearing the hurricane. Why was this? Because he had to leave his own Crystal Sands home and take on a job he didn’t want. That’s why. A hurricane was about to hit Crystal Sands. But it didn’t matter. The fire encircled the cars, everyone terrified for life. A penguin on top of his candy truck was the most terrified, yet you could say he saved everyone. Or at least, saved everyone for that moment. The fire rapidly spread across the forest, leaving scorches and ashes. So many people could have been saved, but no. The planes that could have saved them flew too low, crashing miserably. Now without any resources nor any food, it was hard if Sarepia Forest could help itself.

The penguin, Icy Bluepenguin, couldn’t stand it. She grabbed his water bottle and sprayed the fire, calling the fire department. The sprays sent the fire away, but it still spread. “Everyone, follow me!” she yelled, motioning her flippers. Firefighters arrived, spraying the fires despite their fur brown with burns, like an unknown fossil. Icy was depending on them to stop the fire, as squads were arriving all over to stop it. Another day came. Day after day, night after night. It took a week for the fire to  just stop. It decreased by the water. Eventually it sizzled. Yet, the flames were that vicious only one firefighter survived. The once-glorious tropical land was now nothing but broken houses and ashes.

Everyone was free to move, but many people couldn’t trust others. What if they helped plan that fire? That was because Helpful Climbingpaw was there - the innocent nephew of Fierce, yet people still thought he was helping him plan out the worst possible acts. This led to the “disbandment”. Former news reporters were too scared to even speak or report this terrible event. People started to act like this was the hunger games - you only survive on yourself, and you need to fight and kill just to survive. Helpful was no exception.

The days went by of nearby towns in Mt. Shiveer being invaded by reckless refugees. Locals called them “Danger Zone Jammers”. Helpful, one day, was walking in the pit of Sarepia Theater. Below his eyes he pierced dead thorns. He had some sort of clothing sword intact, and was ready to kill anyone wrongly accusing him. A wretched Icy was right there, helplessly eating a shrimp. That shrimp could have been Helpful’s. Soon, Helpful didn’t seem very helpful anymore. He ran toward Icy, ready to the stab the sword into his neck. We can skip the details of that, but Icy was soon clean and gone. This only led to people thinking that Helpful was a merciless creature.

''… Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped &lt;br&gt; Look at that low plane, fine, then &lt;br&gt; Uh oh, overflow, population, common jammers&lt;br&gt; But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself &lt;br&gt; Jamaa’s lands serves its own needs, listen to your trading requests decrease&lt;br&gt; Tell me with the anger and the reverent in the right, right &lt;br&gt; You vitriolic, explosive, slam fight, bright light &lt;br&gt; Feeling pretty psyched''

How did this affect the other lands? The sudden increase in land loss from Mt. Shiveer and northern Lost Temple of Zios made the space crammed with animals. Many Sarepians were innocent, but the remaining Danger Zone Jammers had killed many animals. Something had to be done.

''…It’s the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; It’s the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; This is the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; And I still tell my buddies I feel fine.''

== Chapter 4: Offer Me Solutions, Offer Me Alternatives…and I Decline ==
It went like that for a week. News anchors kept telling everyone and everything would be fine. Unfortunately, we wish Sparkle Redroo and many other jammers could say the same. Desiring to find food despite him being an alleged Danger Zone Jammer, Sparkle was heading up into a Crystal Sands tower. Already a bloodbath had begun below: the accused launching themselves onto locals and the locals’ spears stabbing into the accuseds’ throats. Sparkle found some leftover pineapple, and shoved it down his throat. “Delicious!” he said, smacking his lips. 

Two wounded tigers entered, them bleeding uncontrollably. They recognized Redroo, and immediately charged at him. For some reason, they didn’t slow down despite the severe pain and discomfort in their legs and arms. The kangaroo managed to dodge them, watching as a sports car pulled up underneath the damaged room. One of the tigers, a green color, growled as he dug his claws into his enemy’s tails. “You aren’t safe,” cried the yellow one. “No matter what.” Sparkle dragged himself to the exit, stumbling upon steps. He had a deep claw mark on his arm and underbelly. For some reason, he knew something was off. The next floor was a living room: complete with a lodge rug, camel couch, and wooden TV. Sitting himself upon the couch, he watched himself bleed. Turning to the news channel to distract him, the president on the scene, Mayor Von Swag, reassured the concerned reporters. “It’ll be fine! I’ve already published a book on this matter!” One reporter, a very young cougar with a vest and concerned face, piped up, “Mayor, will you help people seeking refuge?” The mayor kept silent.

A weary group of eagles, led by a ragged tiger and exhausted kangaroo, entered. Redroo snapped at them, but they lay down anyway. The bloodbath had stopped, police coming to stop the crazy fight. Now Crystal Sands was out of control too. Was this about the hurricane? Redroo tried to find out if it had already happened, but the news never seemed to cover it, no matter how much he tried to go back to the start or fast forward. The kangaroo grumbled, “I’ll never figure out if it is going to happen.” One of the eagles piped, “We came from Sarepia Forest to go to here.” A tiger followed, “A hurricane will hit! Why are people coming here?”

No one was quite sure, but the new visitors tended to Sparkle’s wounds and cuts. They asked him questions and gave him plenty of food. It was almost a perfect day; That was, until something disastrous happened in the afternoon. The heat was unbearable, and it was unusually windy. The fire might blow out at any minute. What fire is that, you may be asking? A bonfire in the middle of Jamaa Township, with angry animals protesting. Most animals were rightful about protesting - doing non-violent protests and simple boycotts. But these animals were like Danger Zone Jammers: violent as the economy collapsed - so many resources were from Sarepia Forest, and now they couldn’t grow them. The market was jumbled up. And these animals were mad: mad about the reactions, mad about the market, mad about AJ. Mayor Von Swag was on a stick above the fire. “No! No! Please, don’t!” he cried, as a little penguin lit the bonfire. I am sad to say that Icy, Alien, Helpful, and Earl are dead by now.

The same cougar reporter watched. No one except the Second Danger Zone Jammers liked this. It was not the appropriate reaction to a situation like this - despite the chaos and how many mayors were doing botched responses,  they could it more peacefully. The cougar was no exception of one of the jammers who thought that. Brave Majormajor was his name. He recorded every single detail in his journal, as the mayor helplessly burned to near-death. Books below his feet were soon just ashes, and many jammers were taking them out and tossing them into the sea. Fires began again, though. It wasn’t until the police arrived at sunset to stop this madness. The mayor was taken to shelter, and the jammers who participated were jailed.

Animals, that night, were talking about solutions. Politics soon became a standard dinner table topic. And Brave was worried something awful might happen. It did - that night, the hurricane hit coastal towns. It was violent and rough. Brave was also immediately put in jail, incorrectly mistaken as a participater. The hurricane rapidly hit his jail, and took the wood, along with the lives of prisoners, both innocent and guilty. And the mayors still didn’t offer good answers. That’s when Jamaa Township wanted to separate from Jamaa. They didn’t want to be associated with the typical “cold-blooded Crystalian” or “merciless Sarepian”. Many saw this offensive and stereotypical - and yes, it was. 

Now innocent people…

Were being blamed for these assumptions.

''Six o'clock, T.V. hour, don't get caught in foreign tower &lt;br&gt; Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn &lt;br&gt; Lock the mayor on a fence item, book burning, bloodletting  &lt;br&gt; Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate &lt;br&gt; Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down &lt;br&gt; Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh &lt;br&gt; This means no fear, pack members, renegade and steering clear &lt;br&gt; A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies &lt;br&gt; Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline &lt;br&gt; … It's the end of Jamaa as we know it&lt;br&gt; It's the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; It's the end of Jamaa as we know it and I feel fine &lt;br&gt; And I still tell my buddies I feel fine (I feel fine)''

==Chapter 5: Mountains Sit In a Line==
It was next week. Two lands - Kimbara and Jamaa Township - were officially divided from Jamaa by themselves. Now Jamaa didn’t have its capital. What would they do without it? The alphas - Sir Gilbert, mostly - thought of alternatives. On a late Monday night, animals gathered to near the animals’ decisions. Liza stepped out, followed by no one. Everyone was confused. As smoke whipped onto itself in the air, Liza coughed, “Unfortunately, Sir Gilbert has had to miss this event. Greeley and Peck have both sadly died from a strange disease. Graham is busy working on a medicine. We will try to do our har- HACK!” 

Liza uncontrollably coughed. No one could hear the news. But it didn’t matter. Soon the smoke entered the lungs of animals, making them fall to the floor instead of breathing. Were they dying? Smoke continued to rise and fall, all from the fires before. This would all lead to Jamaa falling apart, both politically and physically. Later that night, another hurricane smacked the face of Jamaa. A sleepy eagle, humming to himself, looked upward to the sky, from a very distant place. He was someone who was looking for shelter, but none of the very few who did bad things. The eagle coughed at the smoke, listening to the news from a poorly made TV.

He looked to it, seeing it was covering a hurricane. “Hmmm…” The TV paused, just as a volcano erupted. Despite the raging hurricane, dangerous seas, and rough winds, everyone stayed calm in a line of cars, all waiting to leave their lands in case they, any day it could be true, fell to a natural disaster or political shenanigan. Volcanos started erupting all over for some reason, and the eagle could sense it as a warning for something much, much worse. Just by that day, Sir Gilbert had both his birth day and his date with death. The eagle was one of the nurses. “Are you okay, Sir?” he said, entering the room to check on Sir Gilbert. Leaping Bravebear, Lucky Blueboy, Lieutenant Bulkybug, and Little Boldbean were also doctors coming to see if the tiger alpha was okay.

Presents stacked beside him, Sir Gilbert laughed and weakly said, “I’m fine. A little buggy and sick, but I feel fine. Such wonderful birthday presents.” The nurses, however, knew he was not okay at all. In fact, today was the day he might die. They assumed he was going to die. The eagle, named Legit Berrybird, held out his wing to see if Sir Gilbert was hot or not. He was very warm - enough to be considered an extremely serious fever. “Is it warm here, Sir?” Lucky asked, surprised by the news. The alpha chuckled and rasped, “It’s not warm…“ Lieutenant noticed something and quickly addressed, “He’s very pale, and Sir, you have a very high fever.” He smiled, reaching for the last bit of birthday cake and a jellybean. Yet a blinding light flickered from under his bed. 

Suddenly, the light enlarged and exploded. Sir Gilbert disappeared within the dust. No one was quite sure if he was alive, and he most definitely wasn’t. A dead, half-burnt body lie still on the bed, smiling helplessly. “No…” Little said, taking his paws over Gilbert’s. “You’re gone…” Everyone bowed their heads. For the next few weeks, the lands soon drifted apart. Collisions and explosions continued and continued. Everyone was worried, despite the false reminders. Even the people who made up the reminders and had secret hopes were scared. Most jammers were even willing to admit their crushes, embarrassments, mistakes, and secrets. It was end of their life that was near.

Eventually the animals died in and left each land. Kimbara of drought, Mt Shiveer of major ice age, Jamaa Township of earthquake, Crystal Sands of fighting, Coral Canyons of flood, and Sarepia Forest…it already burned down and eventually sunk. The only survivor was Appondale, and animals crowded there. For after what seemed like years the lands remaining collided and formed a mountain range. Jamaa was reuniting. Animals rushed to their old, destroyed homes. Although they probably would die soon anyway, at least they could get a view of their old homes. The smoke in the air killed them. 

And that’s the story of the end of Jamaa. Or it’s animals, at least.
… 

''The other night I drifted nice continental drift divide &lt;br&gt; Mountains sit in a line, Leaping &lt;br&gt; Little, Lieutenant and Lucky &lt;br&gt; Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom &lt;br&gt; You explosive, toxic, slam but neck, right, right''

''It’s the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; it’s the end of Jamaa as we know it &lt;br&gt; Its the end of Jamaa as we know it and I still feel fine &lt;br&gt; it’s the end of Jamaa as we know it…''</text>
